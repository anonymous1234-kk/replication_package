You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''
```

```python
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''

    # Create a min heap with the first n elements of the list
    min_heap = nums[:n]
    hq.heapify(min_heap)
    
    # Iterate over the remaining elements of the list
    for i in range(n, len(nums)):
        # If the current element is greater than the smallest element in the heap
        if nums[i] > min_heap[0]:
            # Replace the smallest element in the heap with the current element
            hq.heappop(min_heap)
            hq.heappush(min_heap, nums[i])
    
    # Return the n largest elements in descending order
    return sorted(min_heap, reverse=True)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert heap_queue_largest([10, 20, -30, -50, 60, 70],-1) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert heap_queue_largest([1],2) == [1]
assert heap_queue_largest([],2) == []
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
