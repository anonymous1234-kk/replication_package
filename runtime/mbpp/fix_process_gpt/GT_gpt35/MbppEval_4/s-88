You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''
```

```python
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''
    heap = []
    for num in nums:
        hq.heappush(heap, -num)
    largest_nums = []
    for i in range(n):
        largest_nums.append(-hq.heappop(heap))
    return largest_nums

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert heap_queue_largest([1],2) == [1]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
