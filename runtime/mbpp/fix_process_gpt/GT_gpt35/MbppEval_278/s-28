I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''

    # Initialize the count variable to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the tuple
    for tup_element in test_tup:
        # Append the current count to the result list
        result.append(count)
        
        # Increment the count by 1 for the next iteration
        count += 1
        
    # Return the result list
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_first_elements((('alpha', 1), ('beta', 2), ('gamma', 3), ('delta', 4), ('epsilon', 5), ('zeta', 6))) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
