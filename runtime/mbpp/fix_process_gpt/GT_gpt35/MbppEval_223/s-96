You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_majority(arr, n, x):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.)
    '''
```

    first_occurrence = bisect_left(arr, x)

    if first_occurrence == n:

    # Check if (n/2 + 1)-th element is same as x
    if (first_occurrence + n // 2) < n and arr[first_occurrence + n // 2] == x:
        return True
    else:
        return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_majority([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],11,4) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
