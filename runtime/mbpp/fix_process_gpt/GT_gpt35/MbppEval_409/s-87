You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    # Initialize the minimum product as None
    min_product = None
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tup in list1:
        # Calculate the product of the tuple elements
        product = tup[0] * tup[1]
        
        # If the minimum product is None, set it to the current product
        if min_product is None:
            min_product = product
        # If the current product is less than the minimum product, update the minimum product
        elif product < min_product:
            min_product = product
    
    # Return the minimum product
    return min_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_product_tuple([(4, 5), (5, 7), (9, 8), (2, 3), (3, 5), (-4, 5)]) == 6
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    for tup in list1:
        product = tup[0] * tup[1]
        if min_product is None:
            min_product = product
        elif product < min_product:
            min_product = product
    return min_product
