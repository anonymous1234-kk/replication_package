You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
    # Initialize the minimum product to infinity
    min_product = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Calculate the product of the current tuple
        product = list1[i][0] * list1[i][1]
        
        # If the product is smaller than the current minimum, update the minimum
        if product < min_product:
            min_product = product
    
    # Return the minimum product
    return min_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_product_tuple([(4, 5), (5, 7), (9, 8), (2, 3), (3, 5), (-4, 5)]) == 6
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
