I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def lcs_of_three(X, Y, Z): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the longest common subsequence for the given three string sequence. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcs-longest-common-subsequence-three-strings/
    '''
```

```python
def lcs_of_three(X, Y, Z): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the longest common subsequence for the given three string sequence. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcs-longest-common-subsequence-three-strings/
    '''
 
    m = len(X) 
    n = len(Y) 
    p = len(Z) 
      
    L = [[[0 for k in range(p + 1)] for j in range(n + 1)] for i in range(m + 1)] 
    
    for i in range(m + 1): 
        for j in range(n + 1): 
            for k in range(p + 1): 
                if (i == 0 or j == 0 or k == 0): 
                    L[i][j][k] = 0
                      
                elif (X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1] and X[i - 1] == Z[k - 1]): 
                    L[i][j][k] = L[i - 1][j - 1][k - 1] + 1
  
                else: 
                    L[i][j][k] = max(max(L[i - 1][j][k], L[i][j - 1][k]), L[i][j][k - 1]) 
   
    return L[m][n][p] 
```

This function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the longest common subsequence of three given strings. The `lcs_of_three` function takes three parameters `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, which are the three strings for which we need to find the longest common subsequence. 

The implementation creates a 3D list `L` to store the lengths of the longest common subsequences for different combinations of prefixes of the three input strings. The `L[i][j][k]` element of the list stores the length of the longest common subsequence of the prefixes `X[:i]`, `Y[:j]`, and `Z[:k]`.

The function uses three nested loops to fill the `L` list based on the following recurrence relation: 

```
L[i][j][k] = 0                                    if i=0 or j=0 or k=0
L[i][j][k] = L[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1                  if X[i-1] == Y[j-1] == Z[k-1]
L[i][j][k] = max(L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k], L[i][j][k-1])  otherwise

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert lcs_of_three('AAB','AAC','AAC') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
