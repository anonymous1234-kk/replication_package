I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def lcs_of_three(X, Y, Z): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the longest common subsequence for the given three string sequence. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcs-longest-common-subsequence-three-strings/
    '''
```

```python
def lcs_of_three(X, Y, Z): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the longest common subsequence for the given three string sequence. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcs-longest-common-subsequence-three-strings/
    '''

    m, n, o = len(X), len(Y), len(Z)
    L = [[[0 for _ in range(o+1)] for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]

    for i in range(m+1):
        for j in range(n+1):
            for k in range(o+1):
                if i == 0 or j == 0 or k == 0:
                    L[i][j][k] = 0
                elif X[i-1] == Y[j-1] == Z[k-1]:
                    L[i][j][k] = L[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1
                else:
                    L[i][j][k] = max(max(L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k]), L[i][j][k-1])
    return L[m][n][o]
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming to find the longest common subsequence for the given three string sequence. The implementation is based on the bottom-up approach of dynamic programming, and it uses a three-dimensional array `L` to store the results. The three dimensions of the array correspond to the three input strings `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. The value `L[i][j][k]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the substrings `X[0:i]`, `Y[0:j]`, and `Z[0:k]`. 

The implementation iterates through all possible combinations of the three input strings, and fills in the array `L` using the following recurrence relation:

```
L[i][j][k] = 0                           if i = 0 or j = 0 or k = 0
            L[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1         if X[i-1] = Y[j-1] = Z[k-1]
            max(L[i-1][j][k], L[i][j-1][k], L[i][j][k-1])     otherwise

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert lcs_of_three('AAB','AAC','AAC') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
