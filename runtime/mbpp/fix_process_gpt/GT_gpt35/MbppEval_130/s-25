You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_occurrences(nums):
    '''
    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_occurrences(nums):
    '''
    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.
    '''

    """
    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.
    """
    # create a defaultdict to store the frequency of each number
    frequency = defaultdict(int)
    # iterate through the list and update the frequency of each number
    for num in nums:
        frequency[num] += 1
    # find the number with the highest frequency
    max_freq = max(frequency.values())
    # create a list to store numbers with the highest frequency
    result = []
    # iterate through the dictionary to find numbers with the highest frequency
    for num, freq in frequency.items():
        if freq == max_freq:
            result.append(num)
    # return the list of numbers with the highest frequency
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_occurrences([3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
