I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty list to store the intersection of tuples
    intersection = []
    
    # Loop through each tuple in the first list
    for tup1 in test_list1:
        # Loop through each tuple in the second list
        for tup2 in test_list2:
            # Check if the two tuples have the same elements, irrespective of order
            if set(tup1) == set(tup2):
                # If the tuples have the same elements, add the tuple to the intersection list
                intersection.append(tup1)
    
    # Return the intersection list
    return intersection

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)],[(3, 4), (2, 1)]) == {(1, 2)}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
