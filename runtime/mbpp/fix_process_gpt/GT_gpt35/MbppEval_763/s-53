I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_min_diff(arr,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-difference-pair/
    '''
```

```python
def find_min_diff(arr,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-difference-pair/
    '''
 
    arr.sort() # Sort the array in ascending order
    min_diff = arr[1] - arr[0] # Initialize minimum difference as the difference between the first two elements
    
    for i in range(2,n): # Loop through the array starting from the third element
        diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1] # Calculate the difference between the current element and the previous element
        if diff < min_diff: # If the difference is less than the current minimum difference
            min_diff = diff # Update the minimum difference to the new difference
            
    return min_diff # Return the minimum difference

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_min_diff([],0) == 100000000000000000000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_min_diff([2, 3, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18],7) == 1
assert find_min_diff([1, 19, -4, 31, 38, 25],6) == 5
assert find_min_diff([30, 5, 20, 9, 40],5) == 4
assert find_min_diff([1, 19, -4],3) == 5
assert find_min_diff([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6],9) == 0
assert find_min_diff([100, 10, 2, 4, 7, 1, 20],7) == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
