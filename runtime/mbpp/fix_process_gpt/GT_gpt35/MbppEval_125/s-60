You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s in the string
    count_0 = 0
    count_1 = 0
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum difference and the current difference
    max_diff = 0
    curr_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in string:
        if char == '0':
            count_0 += 1
        else:
            count_1 += 1
        
        # Update the current difference
        curr_diff = count_0 - count_1
        
        # Update the maximum difference if the current difference is larger
        max_diff = max(max_diff, curr_diff)
        
        # Reset the count variables if they become negative
        count_0 = max(count_0, 0)
        count_1 = max(count_1, 0)
    
    # Return the maximum difference
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
