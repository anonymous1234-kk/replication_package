I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    # Initialize variables to store number of 0s and 1s seen so far
    count_zeros = 0
    count_ones = 0
    
    # Initialize variable to store maximum difference between count of 0s and 1s
    max_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in string:
        # Update count of 0s and 1s seen so far
        if char == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            count_ones += 1
        
        # Update maximum difference between count of 0s and 1s if necessary
        if count_zeros - count_ones > max_diff:
            max_diff = count_zeros - count_ones
        elif count_ones - count_zeros > max_diff:
            max_diff = count_ones - count_zeros
    
    # Return maximum difference between count of 0s and 1s
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
