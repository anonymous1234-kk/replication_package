You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
 
    # Initialize variables to track the count of 0s and 1s
    count_0 = count_1 = 0
    
    # Initialize variable to track the maximum difference
    max_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate through the characters of the string
    for char in string:
        
        # If the character is 0, increment the count of 0s
        if char == '0':
            count_0 += 1
        
        # If the character is 1, increment the count of 1s
        elif char == '1':
            count_1 += 1
        
        # Calculate the difference between the count of 0s and 1s
        diff = count_0 - count_1
        
        # If the difference is greater than the current maximum difference, update the maximum difference
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
        
        # If the count of 0s and 1s is negative, reset them to 0
        if count_0 < 0:
            count_0 = 0
        if count_1 < 0:
            count_1 = 0
    
    # Return the maximum difference
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
