You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set the left most unset bit.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set the left most unset bit.
    '''
 
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Create a variable to hold the current bit
    current_bit = 1
    
    # Loop through each bit of the number
    while n & current_bit:
        current_bit <<= 1
    
    # Once the loop is done, we've found the leftmost unset bit
    # Set it by XORing with the original number
    return n ^ current_bit

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(100) == 116
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
