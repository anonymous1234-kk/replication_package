You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a list to keep track of characters that need to be removed
    chars_to_remove = [False] * NO_OF_CHARS

    # Loop through the second string and mark each character that needs to be removed
    for char in string2:
        chars_to_remove[ord(char)] = True

    # Create an empty list to store the remaining characters
    new_string = []

    # Loop through the first string and only add the characters that are not marked for removal
    for char in string1:
        if not chars_to_remove[ord(char)]:
            new_string.append(char)

    # Combine the remaining characters into a single string and return it
    return ''.join(new_string)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
