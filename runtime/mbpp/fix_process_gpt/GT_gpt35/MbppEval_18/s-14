I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a list to store the characters that are not in the second string
    filtered_string = []
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of characters in the second string
    char_count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
    for char in string:
        char_count[ord(char)] += 1
    
    # Iterate through the characters in the first string and append to filtered_string if not present in the second string
    for char in string:
        if char_count[ord(char)] == 0:
            filtered_string.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of filtered characters into a string and return
    return "".join(filtered_string)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
