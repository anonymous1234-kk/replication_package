I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a count array for storing count of characters in second string
    count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # Traverse the second string and store count of each character in count array
    for i in string[1]:
        count[ord(i)] += 1
        
    # Traverse the first string and remove characters which are present in count array
    result = ""
    for i in string[0]:
        if count[ord(i)] == 0:
            result += i
            
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
