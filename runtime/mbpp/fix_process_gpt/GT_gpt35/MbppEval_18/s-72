I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''

    # Create an empty list to store the new string
    new_string = []
    
    # Create a hash table to store the characters of the second string
    hash_table = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # Loop through the characters of the second string and set their corresponding value in the hash table to 1
    for char in string[1]:
        hash_table[ord(char)] = 1
    
    # Loop through the characters of the first string
    for char in string[0]:
        # Check if the character is present in the hash table
        if not hash_table[ord(char)]:
            # If the character is not present, add it to the new string
            new_string.append(char)
    
    # Return the new string as a list
    return new_string

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
