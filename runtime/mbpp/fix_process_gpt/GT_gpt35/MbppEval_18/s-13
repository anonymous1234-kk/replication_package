You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a dictionary of characters to remove, initialized with False
    char_dict = {chr(i): False for i in range(NO_OF_CHARS)}
    
    # Set the characters in the second string to True
    for char in string[1]:
        char_dict[char] = True
    
    # Create a new string with only the characters not present in the second string
    new_string = ""
    for char in string[0]:
        if not char_dict[char]:
            new_string += char
    
    return new_string

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
