You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    # Initialize a list with a length of 256 (total ASCII characters)
    char_list = [False] * NO_OF_CHARS 

    # Iterate through every character in the second string and mark it as True in char_list
    for char in string: 
        char_list[ord(char)] = True 

    # Create an empty string to store the result
    new_string = "" 

    # Iterate through every character in the first string
    for char in string: 
        # If the character is not present in the second string, add it to the result string
        if not char_list[ord(char)]: 
            new_string += char 

    # Return the result string
    return new_string

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
