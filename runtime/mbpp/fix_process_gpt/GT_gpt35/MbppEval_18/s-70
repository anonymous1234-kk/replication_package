You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    # Create a list with all elements as False
    # The list represents if a character is present in the second string
    present = [False] * NO_OF_CHARS 

    # Iterate through all characters of the second string and set their presence as True
    for char in string: 
        present[ord(char)] = True 

    # Create an empty list to store the characters from first string not present in second string
    result = [] 

    # Iterate through all characters of the first string and append to result only if not present in second string
    for char in string: 
        if not present[ord(char)]: 
            result.append(char) 

    # Return the final list with characters from first string not present in second string
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
