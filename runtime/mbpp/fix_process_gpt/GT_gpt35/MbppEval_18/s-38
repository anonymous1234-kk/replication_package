I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a list to keep count of characters in second string
    count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # Count the number of occurrences of each character in second string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        count[ord(string[i])] += 1
    
    # Create an empty result string to store the filtered characters
    result = ""
    
    # Traverse the first string and append only non-occurring characters to the result string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if count[ord(string[i])] == 0:
            result += string[i]
    
    # Return the filtered string
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ['mask', 'geeksforgeeks']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
