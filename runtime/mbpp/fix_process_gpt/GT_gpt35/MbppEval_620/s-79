You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    # Create a dictionary to store the count of all the remainders when an element in the list is divided by 3.
    count = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0}
    
    # Loop through all the elements in the list and increment the count of the remainder of each element.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        count[a[i] % 3] += 1
    
    # Return the count of the largest subset of the list so that every pair is divisible.
    return count[0] // 2 + min(count[1], count[2])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 3]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
