I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    # initialize a dictionary to store the size of largest subset for each number
    # initially, the size of largest subset for each number is 1
    # because a number is always divisible by itself
    d = {i: 1 for i in a}

    # for each number in the list
    for i in a:
        # for each factor of the number
        for j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                # update the size of largest subset for the factor
                d[j] = max(d[j], d[i] + 1)
                if i // j != j:
                    # update the size of largest subset for the other factor
                    d[i // j] = max(d[i // j], d[i] + 1)

    # return the maximum value in the dictionary
    return max(d.values())

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12]) == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 3]) == 2
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
