You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    n = len(a)
    dp = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if a[i] % a[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([12, 18, 6, 36, 24]) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12]) == 4

assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 4
assert largest_subset([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]) == 3

 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    n = len(a)
    dp = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if a[i] % a[j] == 0 and dp[i] < dp[j] + 1:
                dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
    return max(dp)
```
