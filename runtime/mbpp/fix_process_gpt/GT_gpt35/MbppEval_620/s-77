You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    subsets = [[]]
    for num in a:
        new_subsets = [subset + [num] for subset in subsets]
        subsets.extend(new_subsets)
    divisible_subsets = []
    for subset in subsets:
        if all(subset[i] % subset[j] == 0 or subset[j] % subset[i] == 0 for i in range(len(subset)) for j in range(i + 1, len(subset))):
            divisible_subsets.append(subset)
    return max([len(subset) for subset in divisible_subsets])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]) == 5
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 3]) == 2
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 6, 9]) == 2
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 4
assert largest_subset([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]) == 3
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 5, 10, 20, 21]) == 3
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
