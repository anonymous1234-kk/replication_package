I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def start_withp(words):
    '''
    Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def start_withp(words):
    '''
    Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty list to store words starting with 'p'
    p_words = []
    
    # Loop through each word in the list and check if it starts with 'p'
    for word in words:
        if re.match(r'^p', word):
            # If the word starts with 'p', append it to the list
            p_words.append(word)
            
    # If there are less than two words starting with 'p', return the list as is
    if len(p_words) < 2:
        return p_words
    
    # Otherwise, return the first two words starting with 'p'
    return p_words[:2]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert start_withp(['peach', 'beach', 'teacher', 'head', 'body']) == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
