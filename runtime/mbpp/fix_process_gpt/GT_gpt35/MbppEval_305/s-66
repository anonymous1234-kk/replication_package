I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def start_withp(words):
    '''
    Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def start_withp(words):
    '''
    Write a function to return two words from a list of words starting with letter 'p'.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty list to hold the words starting with 'p'
    p_words = []
    # Loop through each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word starts with 'p' using regular expression
        if re.match('^p', word):
            # If the word starts with 'p', append it to the list
            p_words.append(word)
            # If we have found two words starting with 'p', break out of the loop
            if len(p_words) == 2:
                break
    # Return the list of words starting with 'p'
    return p_words

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert start_withp(['peach', 'beach', 'teacher', 'head', 'body']) == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
