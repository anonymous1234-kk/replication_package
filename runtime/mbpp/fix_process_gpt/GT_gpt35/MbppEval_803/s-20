You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_perfect_square(n) :
    '''
    Write a function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-given-number-is-perfect-square-in-cpp/
    '''
```

    '''

    """
    Check whether the given number is a perfect square or not.

    A number is a perfect square if its square root is an integer.

    Args:
    n (int): the number to check

    Returns:
    bool: True if n is a perfect square, False otherwise
    """
    # If n is less than 0, it cannot be a perfect square
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Take the square root of n
    root = int(n ** 0.5)
    
    # If the square of the root is equal to n, then n is a perfect square
    if root * root == n:
        return True
    
    # Otherwise, n is not a perfect square
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_perfect_square(0) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_perfect_square(987654321) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
