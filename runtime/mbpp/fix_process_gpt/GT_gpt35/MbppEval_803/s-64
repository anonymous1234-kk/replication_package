You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_perfect_square(n) :
    '''
    Write a function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-given-number-is-perfect-square-in-cpp/
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to check whether the given number is a perfect square or not. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-given-number-is-perfect-square-in-cpp/
    '''

    # If the number is less than 0, it can't be a perfect square
    if n < 0:
        return False

    # If the number is 0 or 1, it is a perfect square
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return True

    # Start with 1 and keep adding odd numbers until we reach or surpass the number
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        # If i squared is equal to the number, it is a perfect square
        if i * i == n:
            return True
        i += 2

    # If we have reached this point, the number is not a perfect square
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_perfect_square(0) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_perfect_square(987654321) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
