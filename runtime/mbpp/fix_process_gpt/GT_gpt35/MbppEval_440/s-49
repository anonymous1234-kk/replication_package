You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    words = text.split()              # split the sentence into a list of words
    adverbs = [word for word in words if re.search(r'\b\w+ly\b', word)]  # find all adverbs in the list of words
    if adverbs:                       # if adverbs were found
        first_adverb = adverbs[0]     # get the first adverb
        position = words.index(first_adverb)  # get the position of the first adverb
        return (first_adverb, position)  # return the first adverb and its position
    else:
        return None                   # return None if no adverb was found

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
