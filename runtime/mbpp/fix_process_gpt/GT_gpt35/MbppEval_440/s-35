You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    adverb_pos = None
    adverb = re.findall(r'\b\w+ly\b', text)
    if adverb:
        adverb_pos = [(m.start(0), m.end(0)-1) for m in re.finditer(adverb[0], text)]
    return adverb_pos

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
