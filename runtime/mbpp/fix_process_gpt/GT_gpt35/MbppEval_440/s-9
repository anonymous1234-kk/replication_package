You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    # split the sentence into words
    words = text.split()
    
    # initialize the position to be None
    position = None
    
    # loop through the words
    for i in range(len(words)):
        # if the word ends with "ly", it's an adverb
        if re.search(r'\w+ly$', words[i]):
            # set the position to be the index of the adverb
            position = i
            break
    
    # return the position of the first adverb in the sentence
    return position

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
