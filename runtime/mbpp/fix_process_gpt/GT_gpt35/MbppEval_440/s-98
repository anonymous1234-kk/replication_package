You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    # Define a pattern to match adverbs
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b'
    # Search for the first adverb in the sentence
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    # If an adverb is found, return its position
    if match:
        return match.start()
    # If no adverb is found, return -1
    else:
        return -1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('He works very hard') == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
assert find_adverb_position('She sang sweetly') == (9, 16, 'sweetly')
assert find_adverb_position('He plays the guitar joyfully') == (20, 28, 'joyfully')
```
