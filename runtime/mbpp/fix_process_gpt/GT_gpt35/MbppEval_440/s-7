You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    # split the sentence into words
    words = text.split()
    # initialize variables to store the index of the first adverb and its position
    first_adverb_index = None
    first_adverb_position = None
    # loop through the words and check if it is an adverb
    for index, word in enumerate(words):
        if re.search(r'\b\w+ly\b', word):
            first_adverb_index = index
            first_adverb_position = text.find(word)
            break
    return first_adverb_index, first_adverb_position

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
