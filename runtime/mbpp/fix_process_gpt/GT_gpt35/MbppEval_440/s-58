You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    """
    This function finds the first adverb and its position in a given sentence.

    Parameters:
        text (str): The sentence in which the adverb is to be searched.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the adverb and its starting and ending position in the sentence.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is not a string.
    """
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string")
    
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', text)
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        if re.search(r'\b\w+ly\b', word):
            return word, text.find(word), text.find(word) + len(word) - 1
    return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

    This function finds the first adverb and its position in a given sentence.

    Parameters:

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the starting and ending positions of the adverb, and the adverb itself.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input is not a string.
    """
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string")

    if words:
        word = words[0]
        return text.find(word), text.find(word) + len(word) - 1, word
    return None
