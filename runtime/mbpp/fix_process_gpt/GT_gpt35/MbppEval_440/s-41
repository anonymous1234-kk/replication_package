You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    # Find the first adverb using regex
    adverb_match = re.search(r'\b\w+ly\b', text)

    # If no adverb is found, return None
    if adverb_match is None:
        return None

    # Otherwise, return the adverb and its position
    else:
        adverb = adverb_match.group()
        start = adverb_match.start()
        end = adverb_match.end()
        return (adverb, start, end)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
