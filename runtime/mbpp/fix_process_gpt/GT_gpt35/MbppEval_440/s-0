You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    # Use regular expression to find the first adverb in the given text
    # Adverbs usually end with -ly, so we will search for words ending with -ly
    adverb_match = re.search(r'\b\w*ly\b', text)
    
    # If an adverb is found, return its position in the text
    if adverb_match:
        return adverb_match.span()
    
    # If no adverb is found, return None
    else:
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == (5, 10, 'early')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
