You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
    '''
```

```python
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
    '''
    # Split the string into words by splitting it at '_' symbol
    words = word.split('_')
    
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one
    # Join the words back together with the first letter of each word in uppercase
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.title() for word in words[1:])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert snake_to_camel('arun') == Arun
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert snake_to_camel(' ') ==  
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
