You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
    '''
```

```python
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
    '''
    # Split the word into a list of words using "_" as the separator
    words = word.split("_")
    
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one
    for i in range(1, len(words)):
        words[i] = words[i].capitalize()
    
    # Join the words together to form a single string
    camel_case_word = "".join(words)
    
    # Return the camel case string
    return camel_case_word

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert snake_to_camel('arun') == Arun
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert snake_to_camel(' ') ==  
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
