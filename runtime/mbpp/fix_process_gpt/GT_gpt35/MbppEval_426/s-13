You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def filter_oddnumbers(nums):
    '''
    Write a function to filter odd numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def filter_oddnumbers(nums):
    '''
    Write a function to filter odd numbers.
    '''

    '''

    '''
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert filter_oddnumbers([3.5, 4.5, 7.6, 8.8]) == [3.5, 4.5, 7.6, 8.8]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
