You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math
def sector_area(r,a):
    '''
    Write a function to find area of a sector. The function takes the radius and angle as inputs. Function should return None if the angle is larger than 360 degrees.
    '''
```

def sector_area(r,a):
    '''
    Write a function to find area of a sector. The function takes the radius and angle as inputs. Function should return None if the angle is larger than 360 degrees.

    '''
    if a > 360:
        return None
    else:
        return (a/360) * math.pi * r ** 2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sector_area(5,80) == 17.453292519943297
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
