You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
 
    # Convert the binary string to a list of integers
    s = [int(x) for x in s]
    
    # Count the number of ones in the original binary string
    ones = s.count(1)
    
    # If the number of rotations is even, then the number of ones in the final string
    # will be the same as the number of ones in the original string
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return ones
    
    # If the number of rotations is odd, then the number of ones in the final string
    # will be equal to the length of the string minus the number of ones in the original
    # string
    return len(s) - ones

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
