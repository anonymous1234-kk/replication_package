I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def first_repeated_char(str1):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string.
    '''
```

```python
def first_repeated_char(str1):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string.
    '''

    # iterate through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        # check if the character is repeated
        if str1.count(str1[i]) > 1:
            return str1[i] # return the first repeated character
    return None # return None if no character is repeated

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert first_repeated_char('Python is the most widely used programming language') ==  
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert first_repeated_char('Python') == None
assert first_repeated_char('Confluence') == n
assert first_repeated_char('') == None
assert first_repeated_char('boy') == None
assert first_repeated_char('girl') == None
assert first_repeated_char('random') == None
assert first_repeated_char('') == None
assert first_repeated_char('hockey') == None
assert first_repeated_char('kbcdef') == None
assert first_repeated_char('Ramuraju') == a
assert first_repeated_char('A') == None
assert first_repeated_char('I love Python') ==  
assert first_repeated_char('1234') == None
assert first_repeated_char('Cats') == None
assert first_repeated_char('Test') == None
assert first_repeated_char('Aa') == None
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
