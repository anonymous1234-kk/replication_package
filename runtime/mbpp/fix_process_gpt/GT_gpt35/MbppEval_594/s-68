I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even = None
    odd = None
    for i in list1:
        if i%2 == 0:
            even = i
            break
    for i in list1:
        if i%2 != 0:
            odd = i
            break
    if even is not None and odd is not None:
        return even - odd
    else:
        return "No even or odd number found in the list"

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert diff_even_odd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == 3
assert diff_even_odd([2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == -1
assert diff_even_odd([2, 3, 4, 5, 8]) == -1
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13]) == 3
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12]) == 3
assert diff_even_odd([2, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == -3
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]) == 1
assert diff_even_odd([2, 5, 1, 7, 8, 10]) == -3
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]) == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
