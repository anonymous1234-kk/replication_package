You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''
```

```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even, odd = None, None  # Initializing even and odd to None
    for num in list1:
        if num % 2 == 0:  # Checking if the number is even
            even = num
            break  # Found the first even number, so break out of the loop
        if num % 2 == 1:  # Checking if the number is odd
            odd = num
            break  # Found the first odd number, so break out of the loop
    if even is None or odd is None:  # If either even or odd is not found
        return None
    return even - odd  # Difference between the first even and first odd number

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

        if num % 2 == 1:

    if even is None or odd is None:
        return None
    return even - odd
