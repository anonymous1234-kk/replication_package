You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def set_middle_bits(n):  
    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''
```

def set_middle_bits(n):  
    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''

    # Calculate the number of bits in the given integer
    num_bits = n.bit_length()
    
    # If there are less than or equal to 2 bits, return the original number
    if num_bits <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Create a binary number with all bits set except the first and last bits
    mask = (1 << (num_bits - 2)) - 1
    
    # Toggle the bits in the given number except the first and last bits
    return n ^ mask ^ (1 << (num_bits - 1))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert set_middle_bits(3) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
