You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def set_middle_bits(n):  
    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''
```

    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''
  
    """
    Toggles bits of the number except the first and the last bit.

    Example:
    set_middle_bits(47) -> 206
    set_middle_bits(10) -> 5

    Args:
    n (int): Input number.

    Returns:
    int: Resulting number after toggling middle bits.
    """
    # Get the binary representation of the number
    binary = bin(n)[2:]

    # If the number has less than 3 bits, we can't toggle anything
    if len(binary) < 3:
        return n

    # Toggle all bits except the first and last
    toggled = "1" + "".join(["0" if bit == "1" else "1" for bit in binary[1:-1]]) + "1"

    # Convert the binary string back to an integer and return it
    return int(toggled, 2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert set_middle_bits(3) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
