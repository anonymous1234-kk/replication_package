I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def set_middle_bits(n):  
    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''

    # Count the number of bits in the given number
    num_bits = (n).bit_length()
  
    # Create a variable to store the result
    result = 0
  
    # Iterate over each bit and toggle the bits except first and last
    for i in range(num_bits-1):
        # Extract the i-th bit
        bit = (n >> i) & 1
  
        # Check if the bit is the first or last bit
        if i == 0 or i == num_bits-2:
            # If it's the first or last bit, don't toggle it
            result |= bit << i
        else:
            # If it's not the first or last bit, toggle it
            result |= (1 - bit) << i
  
    # Return the result
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert set_middle_bits(3) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
