I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty set to hold shared elements
    shared_elements = set()

    # Iterate over elements of the first tuple
    for elem in test_tup1:
        # If the element is present in the second tuple, add it to the shared_elements set
        if elem in test_tup2:
            shared_elements.add(elem)

    # Return the shared elements as a tuple
    return tuple(shared_elements)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert similar_elements(['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O'],['H', 'O', 'L', 'L', 'E', 'R']) == ('L', 'E', 'H', 'O')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the count of each element
    count_dict = {}

    # Iterate over elements of the first tuple
    for elem in test_tup1:
        # If the element is already present in the dictionary, increment its count
        if elem in count_dict:
            count_dict[elem] += 1
        # Otherwise, add the element to the dictionary with count 1
        else:
            count_dict[elem] = 1

    # Initialize an empty list to hold the shared elements
    shared_elements = []

    # Iterate over elements of the second tuple
    for elem in test_tup2:
        # If the element is present in the dictionary and its count is greater than 0, add it to the shared_elements list
        if elem in count_dict and count_dict[elem] > 0:
            shared_elements.append(elem)
            # Decrement the count of the element in the dictionary
            count_dict[elem] -= 1

    # Return the shared elements as a tuple
    return tuple(shared_elements)
```
