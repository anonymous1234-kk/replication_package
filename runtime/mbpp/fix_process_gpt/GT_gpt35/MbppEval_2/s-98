You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
    '''
```

```python
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
    '''
    # Convert the given tuples into sets
    set1 = set(test_tup1)
    set2 = set(test_tup2)
    
    # Find the intersection of two sets
    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert the set into a list and return the result
    return list(intersection)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert similar_elements(['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O'],['H', 'O', 'L', 'L', 'E', 'R']) == ('L', 'E', 'H', 'O')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
