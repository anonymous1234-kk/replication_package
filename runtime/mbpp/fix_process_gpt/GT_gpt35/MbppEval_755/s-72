I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''

    # Sort the numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Return the second element in the sorted list
    return numbers[1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert second_smallest([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert second_smallest([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2

 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
