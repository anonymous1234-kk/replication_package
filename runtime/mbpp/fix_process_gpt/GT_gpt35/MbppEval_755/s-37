You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''

    smallest = float('inf')
    second_smallest = float('inf')
    for num in numbers:
        if num < smallest:
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = num
        elif num < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = num
    return second_smallest

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert second_smallest([10, 10, 10, 10, 10]) == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''

    smallest = float('inf')
    second_smallest = float('inf')
    for num in numbers:
        if num < smallest:
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = num
        elif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:
            second_smallest = num
    return second_smallest

```
