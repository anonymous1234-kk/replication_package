You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''
```

```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''

    str1 = str(n1)
    str2 = str(n2)
    len1 = len(str1)
    len2 = len(str2)
    diff = 0
    if len1 != len2:
        return -1
    for i in range(len1):
        diff += abs(int(str1[i]) - int(str2[i]))
    return diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(2000,489) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(234,489) == 12
assert digit_distance_nums(200,489) == 19
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

    str1 = str(n1)

        return -1
    for i in range(len1):
        diff += abs(int(str1[i]) - int(str2[i]))
