You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''
```

```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.

    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''
    # find absolute difference between n1 and n2
    num = abs(n1-n2)
    
    # convert the number to string
    num = str(num)
    
    # initialize result variable to store sum of per-digit difference
    result = 0
    
    # loop through each digit in the number
    for i in range(len(num)):
        # add the absolute difference between the digits of n1 and n2 to the result
        result += abs(int(num[i]) - int(str(n1)[i]))
        
    # return the result
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(234,489) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
