You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
    # Initialize an empty list for the coefficients
    coeffs = [0] * (n+1)
    # Set the first coefficient to 1
    coeffs[0] = 1
  
    # Iterate over the rows of the triangle
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(n, i-1, -1):
            coeffs[j] = (j-i+1) * coeffs[j] + (i+1) * coeffs[j-1]
      
    # Return the last coefficient
    return coeffs[n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(4,2) == 11
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

            coeffs[j] = (j-i+1) * coeffs[j] + (i+1) * coeffs[j-1]

    return coeffs[n]
