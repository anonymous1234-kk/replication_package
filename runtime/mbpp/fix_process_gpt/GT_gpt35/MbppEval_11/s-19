You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''

    # find first occurrence of the given character
    first_occurrence = s.find(ch)

    # if the character is not found in the string, return the original string
    if first_occurrence == -1:
        return s

    # find last occurrence of the given character
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(ch)

    # if the first and last occurrence of the given character are same
    if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
        # remove the character from the string
        s = s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        # remove first occurrence of the given character from the string
        s = s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:]

        # remove last occurrence of the given character from the string
        s = s[:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]

    # return the updated string
    return s

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_Occ('Merry Christmas','r') == Mery Chistmas
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
