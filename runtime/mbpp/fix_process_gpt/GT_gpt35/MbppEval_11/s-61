You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''

    # Find first and last occurrence of the character
    first_occurrence = s.find(ch)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(ch)

    # If character is not present or occurs only once, return the original string
    if first_occurrence == -1 or first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
        return s

    # Remove first and last occurrence of the character
    return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence+1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence+1:]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_Occ('whatsup','w') == hatsup
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert remove_Occ('Merry Christmas','r') == Mery Chistmas
assert remove_Occ('Python and Machine Learning','n') == Pytho and Machine Learnig
assert remove_Occ('Python is a high level language','a') == Python is  high level languge
assert remove_Occ('pypypy','p') == ypyy
assert remove_Occ('bannana','n') == banaa
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    first_occurrence = s.find(ch)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_occurrence == -1 or first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
        return s
    return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence+1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence+1:]
```
