You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # mask to extract leftmost d bits
    mask = (1 << 32 - d) - 1
    
    # extract leftmost d bits
    leftmost = n >> 32 - d
    
    # shift leftmost d bits to the end
    rotated_leftmost = leftmost << d
    
    # extract rightmost 32-d bits
    rightmost = n & mask
    
    # combine rotated leftmost d bits with rightmost 32-d bits
    result = rotated_leftmost | rightmost
    
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
