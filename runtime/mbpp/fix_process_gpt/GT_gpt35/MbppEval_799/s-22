You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
    # Left shift n by d bits and extract the leftmost 32 bits using bitwise AND with 0xFFFFFFFF
    left_rotated = (n << d) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    # Right shift n by (32 - d) bits and extract the rightmost d bits using bitwise AND with 2**d - 1
    right_rotated = (n >> (32 - d)) & (2**d - 1)
    
    # Combine the left and right rotations using bitwise OR
    return left_rotated | right_rotated

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(72345678,10) == 74081974289
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
assert left_rotate(256,8) == 65536
assert left_rotate(123456789,5) == 3950617248
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
