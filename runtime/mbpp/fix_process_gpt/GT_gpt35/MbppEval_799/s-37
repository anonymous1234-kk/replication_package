You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # mask to get the last 32 bits
    mask = (1 << 32) - 1
    
    # shifting the bits to the left by d positions
    left_part = (n << d) & mask
    
    # shifting the bits to the right by 32 - d positions
    right_part = (n >> (32 - d)) & mask
    
    # combining the left and right parts
    return left_part | right_part

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(72345678,10) == 74081974289
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
assert left_rotate(256,8) == 65536
assert left_rotate(123456789,5) == 3950617248
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
