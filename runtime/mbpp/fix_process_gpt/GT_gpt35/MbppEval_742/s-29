You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math
def area_tetrahedron(side):
    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''
```

```python
import math
def area_tetrahedron(side):
    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''
    # Calculate the height of the tetrahedron using the Pythagorean theorem
    height = (side**2 - (0.5*side)**2)**0.5
    
    # Calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron using the formula: 0.5 * base * height
    face_area = 0.5 * side * height
    
    # Calculate the total area of the tetrahedron by multiplying the area of a single face by 4
    total_area = 4 * face_area
    
    # Return the total area of the tetrahedron
    return total_area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert area_tetrahedron(5) == 43.30127018922193
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert area_tetrahedron(2) == 6.928203230275509
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
