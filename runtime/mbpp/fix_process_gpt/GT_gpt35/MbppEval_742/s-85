You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math
def area_tetrahedron(side):
    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''
```

```python
import math
def area_tetrahedron(side):
    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a tetrahedron.

    A tetrahedron is a pyramid with a triangular base. It is a polyhedron that has four faces, 
    where each face is an equilateral triangle. The area of a tetrahedron can be calculated 
    using the following formula:
    
    area = (math.sqrt(3) * side ** 2) / 4
    
    where side is the length of the side of the tetrahedron.

    Parameters:
    side (float): The length of the side of the tetrahedron.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the tetrahedron.
    '''
    area = (math.sqrt(3) * side ** 2) / 4
    return area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert area_tetrahedron(2) == 6.928203230275509
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
