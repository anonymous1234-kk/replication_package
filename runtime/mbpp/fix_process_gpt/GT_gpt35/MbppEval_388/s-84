You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.
    '''
 
    res = 0
    for i in range(n.bit_length() - 1, -1, -1): 
        if ((1 << i) & n): 
            res = 1 << i 
            break 
    return res

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert highest_Power_of_2(-10) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
