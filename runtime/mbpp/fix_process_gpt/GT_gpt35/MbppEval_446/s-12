I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
    # Creating a Counter object from the tuple
    tup_count = Counter(tup)
    
    # Creating an empty dictionary to store the count of elements from the list
    count_dict = {}
    
    # Looping over the list
    for elem in lst:
        # Checking if the element is present in the tuple
        if elem in tup_count:
            # If yes, then adding its count to the dictionary
            count_dict[elem] = tup_count[elem]
    
    # Returning the dictionary
    return count_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
