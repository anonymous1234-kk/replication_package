I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''

    # Initialize the counter object
    count_dict = Counter(tup)
    
    # Initialize the result dictionary
    result_dict = {}
    
    # Loop through each element in the input list
    for elem in lst:
        
        # If the element is present in the tuple, add its count to the result dictionary
        if elem in count_dict:
            result_dict[elem] = count_dict[elem]
        
        # If the element is not present in the tuple, set its count to 0 in the result dictionary
        else:
            result_dict[elem] = 0
    
    # Return the result dictionary
    return result_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
