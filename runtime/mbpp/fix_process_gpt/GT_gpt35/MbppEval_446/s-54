You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
    # initialize an empty dictionary to keep count of occurrences of elements in list
    count_dict = {}
    # loop through each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # check if the element is present in the tuple
        if element in tup:
            # count the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple
            count = tup.count(element)
            # add the element and its count to the dictionary
            count_dict[element] = count
    # convert the dictionary to a Counter object and return it
    return Counter(count_dict)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    count_dict = {}
    for element in lst:
        if element in tup:
            count = tup.count(element)
            count_dict[element] = count
    return sum(count_dict.values())
```
