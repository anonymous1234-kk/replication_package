I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.

    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.

    # Creating a Counter object from the input list
    counts = Counter(lst)
    
    # Creating an empty dictionary to store the counts of each element in the tuple
    tup_counts = {}
    
    # Looping through each element in the tuple
    for element in tup:
        # Checking if the element is in the Counter object
        if element in counts:
            # If it is, add the count to the dictionary
            tup_counts[element] = counts[element]
        else:
            # If it is not, add 0 to the dictionary
            tup_counts[element] = 0
    
    # Returning the dictionary of counts
    return tup_counts

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
