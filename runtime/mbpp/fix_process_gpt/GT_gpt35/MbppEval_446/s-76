I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
    # creating a Counter object for the tuple
    tup_counter = Counter(tup)
    
    # creating a dictionary to store the occurrence of elements from list in the tuple
    result = {}
    
    # iterating over the elements of list
    for element in lst:
        # checking if the element is present in the tuple
        if element in tup_counter:
            # if present, storing the count of occurrence of the element in the dictionary
            result[element] = tup_counter[element]
        else:
            # if not present, storing 0 as count of occurrence of the element in the dictionary
            result[element] = 0
            
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
