You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
    # creating a Counter object from the tuple
    freq_dict = Counter(tup)
    
    # creating an empty dictionary to store the frequency of list elements
    result_dict = {}
    
    # iterating through the list and checking the frequency in the Counter object
    for element in lst:
        result_dict[element] = freq_dict[element]
    
    # returning the result dictionary
    return result_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from collections import Counter 

def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    freq_dict = Counter(tup)
    result_dict = {}
    
    for element in lst:
        result_dict[element] = freq_dict[element]
    
    return sum(result_dict.values())
```
