You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def mul_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def mul_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even = 1
    odd = 1
    for i in list1:
        if i % 2 == 0 and even != 0:
            even *= i
        elif i % 2 != 0 and odd != 0:
            odd *= i
    return even * odd

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert mul_even_odd([3, 4, 6, 9, 1, 2]) == 12
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
