I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    '''

    '''

    # initialize two pointers to the start and end of the array
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
  
    while left <= right:
        # move the left pointer to the right until a positive number is found
        while left < n and arr[left] < 0:
            left += 1
          
        # move the right pointer to the left until a negative number is found
        while right >= 0 and arr[right] >= 0:
            right -= 1
          
        # if the left and right pointers have not crossed, swap the numbers at those positions
        if left < right:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
          
    return arr

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4],6) == [-4, -1, 3, 1, 2, 4]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert re_arrange_array([0, 2, 0, -1],4) == [-1, 2, 0, 0]
assert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, 3, -4],4) == [-1, -4, 3, 2]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
