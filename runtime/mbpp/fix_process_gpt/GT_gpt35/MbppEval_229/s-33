I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    '''

    # Initialize two empty lists to store negative and positive elements
    neg = []
    pos = []

    # Loop through the first n elements of the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the element is negative or positive and add to the corresponding list
        if arr[i] < 0:
            neg.append(arr[i])
        else:
            pos.append(arr[i])

    # Concatenate the negative and positive lists in the correct order
    new_arr = neg + pos

    # Copy the re-arranged elements back to the original array
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = new_arr[i]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([0, 2, 0, -1],4) == [-1, 2, 0, 0]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
