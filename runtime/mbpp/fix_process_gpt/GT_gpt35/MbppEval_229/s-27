I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    # Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array
    left = 0
    right = n - 1

    # While the pointers haven't crossed each other
    while left <= right:
        # If the element at the left pointer is negative, move the pointer to the right
        if arr[left] < 0:
            left += 1
        # If the element at the right pointer is positive, move the pointer to the left
        elif arr[right] > 0:
            right -= 1
        # If the element at the left pointer is positive and the element at the right pointer is negative, swap them
        else:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
    # Return the modified array
    return arr

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([0, 2, 0, -1],4) == [-1, 2, 0, 0]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
