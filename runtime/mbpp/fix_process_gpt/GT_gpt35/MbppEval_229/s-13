I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    '''

    # Initialize two pointers for negative and positive numbers respectively
    neg_ptr = 0
    pos_ptr = n - 1
    
    # Traverse through the array while the two pointers do not cross each other
    while neg_ptr <= pos_ptr:
        # If the current element is negative, move it to the front of the array
        if arr[neg_ptr] < 0:
            neg_ptr += 1
        # If the current element is positive, swap it with the last element
        elif arr[pos_ptr] > 0:
            arr[neg_ptr], arr[pos_ptr] = arr[pos_ptr], arr[neg_ptr]
            pos_ptr -= 1
        # If the current element is already in its correct position, move to the next element
        else:
            pos_ptr -= 1
    return arr

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([0, 2, 0, -1],4) == [-1, 2, 0, 0]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python

    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.

    neg_ptr = 0
    pos_ptr = n - 1
    
    # Traverse through the array while the two pointers do not cross each other
    while neg_ptr <= pos_ptr:
        # If the current element is negative, move it to the front of the array
        if arr[neg_ptr] < 0:
            neg_ptr += 1
        # If the current element is positive, swap it with the last element
        elif arr[pos_ptr] >= 0:
            arr[neg_ptr], arr[pos_ptr] = arr[pos_ptr], arr[neg_ptr]
            pos_ptr -= 1
        # If the current element is already in its correct position, move to the next element
        else:
            pos_ptr -= 1
    return arr
```
