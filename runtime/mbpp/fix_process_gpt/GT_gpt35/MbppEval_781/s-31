You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def count_divisors(n) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the count of divisors is even. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/basic/python-basic-1-exercise-24.php
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def count_divisors(n) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the count of divisors is even. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/basic/python-basic-1-exercise-24.php
    '''
 
    # Find the square root of n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n))

    # If the square root is a divisor, count it twice
    if root * root == n:
        return 2
    else:
        # Count the divisors up to the square root
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, root):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 2

        # If n is a perfect square, we've already counted the square root
        if n % root == 0:
            count += 1

        return count % 2 == 0

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_divisors(16) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert count_divisors(23) == True
assert count_divisors(5) == True
assert count_divisors(5) == True
assert count_divisors(5) == True
assert count_divisors(13) == True
assert count_divisors(5) == True
assert count_divisors(7) == True
assert count_divisors(13) == True
assert count_divisors(19) == True
assert count_divisors(10) == True
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
