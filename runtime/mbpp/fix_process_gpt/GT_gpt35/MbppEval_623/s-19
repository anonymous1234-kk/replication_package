You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def nth_nums(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to compute the n-th power of each number in a list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def nth_nums(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to compute the n-th power of each number in a list.
    '''

    return [num**n for num in nums]
```

This function takes a list of numbers `nums` and an integer `n` as arguments. It returns a new list containing the `n`-th power of each element in `nums`. 

For example:

```python
>>> nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> nth_nums(nums, 2)
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert nth_nums([10, 20, 30],4) == [10000, 160000, 810000]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
