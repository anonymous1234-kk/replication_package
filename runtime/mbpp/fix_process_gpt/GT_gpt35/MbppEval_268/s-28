You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_star_num(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the n'th star number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_star_num(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the n'th star number.
    '''
 
    return 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
```

The star numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be represented by a regular polygon with a central point and points on its circumference. The first few star numbers are:

```
1, 13, 37, 73, 121, 181, 253, 337, 433, 541, 661, ...

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_star_num(5) == 121
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
