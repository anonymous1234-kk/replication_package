You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_Product(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find a pair with highest product from a given array of integers.
    '''
```

```python
def max_Product(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find a pair with highest product from a given array of integers.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return "Array should have at least two elements"
  
    # Initialize maximum products
    max_product = arr[0] * arr[1]
    max_i, max_j = 0, 1
  
    # Traverse through every possible pair
    # and keep track of maximum product
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[i] * arr[j] > max_product:
                max_product = arr[i] * arr[j]
                max_i = i
                max_j = j
  
    # return the pair and the maximum product
    return arr[max_i], arr[max_j], max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_Product([7, -1, -2, 8, -2]) == (7, 8)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
