You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    """
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.

    A lucid number is a positive integer that can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 2.
    For example, 10 is a lucid number because it can be represented as 2^1 + 2^3. 

    Args:
    n -- the maximum integer to check for lucid numbers

    Returns:
    A list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to n.
    """

    lucid_numbers = [1]
    current_number = 2

    while current_number <= n:
        count = 0
        temp = current_number

        while temp % 2 == 0:
            temp //= 2
            count += 1

        if count <= len(lucid_numbers):
            lucid_numbers.append(current_number)

        current_number += 1

    return lucid_numbers

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(4) == [1, 2, 3]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
