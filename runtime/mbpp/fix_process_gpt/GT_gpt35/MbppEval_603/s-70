I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(20) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]

 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    # Initialize a list with first two lucid numbers
    ludic_numbers = [1, 2]
    
    # Initialize a list with all numbers from 3 to n
    all_numbers = list(range(3, n+1))
    
    # Loop through all the numbers in the all_numbers list
    for num in all_numbers:
        for ludic_num in ludic_numbers[1:]:
            if num % ludic_num == 0:
                # If the number is divisible by any lucid number other than 1, break the loop and move on to the next number
                break
        else:
            # If the loop completes without any breaks, that means the number is not divisible by any lucid number other than 1, so it is a lucid number. Append it to the list of ludic numbers.
            ludic_numbers.append(num)
            
    return ludic_numbers[:n]
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(104) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 25, 29, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 61, 67, 71, 77, 83, 89, 91, 97]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

assert get_ludic(7) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
assert get_ludic(8) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
assert get_ludic(9) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
