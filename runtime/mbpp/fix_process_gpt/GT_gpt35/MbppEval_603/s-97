You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    lucid_numbers = [1]
    i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
    while len(lucid_numbers) < n:
        next_lucid = min(lucid_numbers[i] * 2, lucid_numbers[j] * 3, lucid_numbers[k] * 5)
        lucid_numbers.append(next_lucid)
        if next_lucid == lucid_numbers[i] * 2:
            i += 1
        if next_lucid == lucid_numbers[j] * 3:
            j += 1
        if next_lucid == lucid_numbers[k] * 5:
            k += 1
    return lucid_numbers[:n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(4) == [1, 2, 3]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
