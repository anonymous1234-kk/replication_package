You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    """
    Returns a list of all Ludic numbers smaller than or equal to n.

    A Ludic number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of a unique subset of the
    prime numbers {2, 3, 5}.

    Args:
        n: An integer

    Returns:
        A list of Ludic numbers less than or equal to n

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
