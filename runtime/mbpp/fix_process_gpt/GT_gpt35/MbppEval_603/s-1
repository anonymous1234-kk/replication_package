You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    """
    Returns all ludic numbers smaller than or equal to n.

    A ludic number is a positive integer that appears in the Ludic sequence,
    which starts with [1]. The Ludic sequence is obtained by removing each
    k-th element from the sequence of natural numbers [1, 2, 3, ...], where
    k takes on the successive values of the sequence itself, starting from 2.

    Example:
    get_ludic(20) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20]

    :param n: an integer
    :return: a list of ludic numbers
    """
    # Create a list of natural numbers [1, 2, 3, ...]
    nums = list(range(1, n+1))

    # Initialize the Ludic sequence with the first element
    ludic = [1]

    # While there are still elements in the sequence, remove the k-th element
    # from the list and add it to the Ludic sequence, where k takes on the
    # successive values of the Ludic sequence itself, starting from 2.
    k = 2
    while nums:
        # Remove the k-th element from the list of natural numbers
        nums = [num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if (i+1) % k != 0]

        # If there are still elements in the list, add the k-th element to the
        # Ludic sequence and increment k.
        if nums:
            ludic.append(nums[k-2])
            k += 1

    return ludic

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
