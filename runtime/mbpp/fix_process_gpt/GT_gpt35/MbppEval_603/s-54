I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    # Initialize the list with first lucid number 1
    ludic_list = [1]

    # Initialize the factors list with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
    factors = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

    # Iterate until we get all lucid numbers up to n
    while len(ludic_list) < n:
        # Get the minimum of the factors list
        next_ludic = min(factors)
        # Add the next ludic number to the list
        ludic_list.append(next_ludic)
        # Remove the next ludic number from the factors list
        factors.remove(next_ludic)
        # Add the multiples of the next ludic number to the factors list
        for factor in factors:
            factors.append(next_ludic * factor)

    return ludic_list[:n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    ludic_list = [1]
    factors = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

    while len(ludic_list) < n:
        next_ludic = min(factors)
        ludic_list.append(next_ludic)
        factors.remove(next_ludic)
        for factor in factors[:]:
            factors.append(next_ludic * factor)

    return ludic_list[:n]
```

This fixed code should pass all the given test cases.
