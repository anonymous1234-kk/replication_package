You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
    lucid_numbers = [1]
    current_number = 2

    while len(lucid_numbers) < n:
        if all(current_number % ln != 0 for ln in lucid_numbers):
            lucid_numbers.append(current_number)
        current_number += 1

    return lucid_numbers[:n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_numbers = [1]
    current_number = 2

    while len(lucid_numbers) < n:
        if all(current_number % ln != 0 for ln in lucid_numbers):
            lucid_numbers.append(current_number)
        current_number += 1

    return lucid_numbers[:n]
```
