You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    # Initialize the sequence with the first lucid number
    ludic_seq = [1]
    
    # Initialize the factors to be used to generate lucid numbers
    factors = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    
    # Iterate until we have enough lucid numbers
    while len(ludic_seq) < n:
        # Find the smallest factor that has not been used yet
        smallest_factor = None
        for factor in factors:
            if factor not in ludic_seq:
                smallest_factor = factor
                break
        
        # Generate the next lucid number using the smallest unused factor
        next_lucid = smallest_factor
        
        # Remove all multiples of the smallest unused factor from the factors list
        for factor in factors:
            if factor % smallest_factor == 0:
                factors.remove(factor)
        
        # Add the next lucid number to the sequence
        ludic_seq.append(next_lucid)
    
    # Return the sequence of ludic numbers up to the given limit
    return ludic_seq[:n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(4) == [1, 2, 3]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
