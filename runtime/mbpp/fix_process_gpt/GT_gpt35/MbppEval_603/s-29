I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.

    # initialize list with first lucid number
    ludic_nums = [1]
    
    # initialize variables
    curr_num = 2
    divisor = 2
    
    # loop until desired number of ludic numbers is reached
    while len(ludic_nums) < n:
        # if current number is prime or has only 2 or 3 as factors, add to ludic_nums
        if all(curr_num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(curr_num ** 0.5) + 1)) or all(curr_num % i not in [2,3] for i in range(2, int(curr_num ** 0.5) + 1)):
            ludic_nums.append(curr_num)
        # increment current number and reset divisor to 2
        curr_num += 1
        divisor = 2
        # divide by smallest possible divisor until no longer divisible
        while curr_num % divisor != 0:
            divisor += 1
    
    # return list of ludic numbers
    return ludic_nums[:n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(4) == [1, 2, 3]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
