You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    ludics = [1]
    i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0
    next_ludic = 2
    
    while next_ludic <= n:
        ludics.append(next_ludic)
        next_ludic = ludics[i2] * 2
        
        if next_ludic == ludics[i3] * 3:
            i3 += 1
            next_ludic = ludics[i3] * 3
        
        if next_ludic == ludics[i5] * 5:
            i5 += 1
            next_ludic = ludics[i5] * 5
        
        i2 += 1
    
    return ludics

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
