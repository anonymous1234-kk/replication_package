You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    lucid_nums = [1]
    i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0
    next_2, next_3, next_5 = 2, 3, 5

    for i in range(1, n):
        next_lucid = min(next_2, next_3, next_5)
        lucid_nums.append(next_lucid)

        if next_lucid == next_2:
            i2 += 1
            next_2 = lucid_nums[i2] * 2

        if next_lucid == next_3:
            i3 += 1
            next_3 = lucid_nums[i3] * 3

        if next_lucid == next_5:
            i5 += 1
            next_5 = lucid_nums[i5] * 5

    return lucid_nums

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(4) == [1, 2, 3]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    lucid_nums = [1]
    i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0
    next_2, next_3, next_5 = 2, 3, 5

    for i in range(1, n):
        next_lucid = min(next_2, next_3, next_5)
        lucid_nums.append(next_lucid)

        if next_lucid == next_2:
            i2 += 1
            next_2 = lucid_nums[i2] * 2

        if next_lucid == next_3:
            i3 += 1
            next_3 = lucid_nums[i3] * 3

        if next_lucid == next_5:
            i5 += 1
            next_5 = lucid_nums[i5] * 5

    return lucid_nums
```
