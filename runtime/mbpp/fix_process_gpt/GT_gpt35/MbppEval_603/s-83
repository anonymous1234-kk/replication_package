I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

    lucid_numbers = [1]

        if k < j:
            next_lucid = lucid_numbers[i] * 5
            if next_lucid not in lucid_numbers:
                lucid_numbers.append(next_lucid)
            k += 1
        i += 1
    return lucid_numbers[:n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(4) == [1, 2, 3]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
assert get_ludic(3) == [1, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
