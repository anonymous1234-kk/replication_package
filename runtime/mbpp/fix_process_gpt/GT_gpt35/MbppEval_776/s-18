You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_vowels(test_str):
    '''
    Write a function to count those characters which have vowels as their neighbors in the given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_vowels(test_str):
    '''
    Write a function to count those characters which have vowels as their neighbors in the given string.
    '''

    count = 0
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'

    for i in range(len(test_str)-1):
        if test_str[i] in vowels and test_str[i+1] in vowels:
            count += 1

    return count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_vowels('I am fine thank you') == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
