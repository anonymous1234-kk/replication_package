You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''

    # Traverse through all elements in the array
    for i in range(0, len(arr), 2):
        # If the current element is not equal to the next element
        if i == len(arr)-1 or arr[i] != arr[i+1]:
            # Return the current element as it appears only once
            return arr[i]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert search([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7]) == 5
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert search([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 50, 50, 60, 60, 140, 140]) == 2
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
