You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''
```

```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # If array has only one element, it is the required element
    if n == 1:
        return arr[0]
    # Check for corner cases
    if arr[0] != arr[1]:
        return arr[0]
    if arr[n-1] != arr[n-2]:
        return arr[n-1]
    # Perform binary search
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        # If mid element is not repeated, it is the required element
        if arr[mid] != arr[mid-1] and arr[mid] != arr[mid+1]:
            return arr[mid]
        # If mid element is repeated and is even indexed, required element is on right side
        elif arr[mid] == arr[mid+1] and mid % 2 == 0:
            l = mid + 1
        # If mid element is repeated and is odd indexed, required element is on left side
        elif arr[mid] == arr[mid-1] and mid % 2 == 1:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert search([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 50, 50, 60, 60, 140, 140]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
