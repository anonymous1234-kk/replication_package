I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def maxAverageOfPath(cost):
    '''
    Given a square matrix of size N*N given as a list of lists, where each cell is associated with a specific cost. A path is defined as a specific sequence of cells that starts from the top-left cell move only right or down and ends on bottom right cell. We want to find a path with the maximum average over all existing paths. Average is computed as total cost divided by the number of cells visited in the path.
    '''
```

    n = len(cost)
    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + cost[0][i]

        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]

    return round(dp[n-1][n-1]/(2*n-1), 2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) == 2.6666666666666665
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
