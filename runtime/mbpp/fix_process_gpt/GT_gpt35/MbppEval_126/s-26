I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''

    # Find the smaller of two numbers
    min_num = min(a, b)
    # Initialize sum variable
    total_sum = 0
    # Loop through 1 to the min_num+1
    for i in range(1, min_num+1):
        # Check if the i-th number is a divisor of both a and b
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            # Add the divisor to the sum
            total_sum += i
    # Return the total sum of common divisors
    return total_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sum(10,20) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
