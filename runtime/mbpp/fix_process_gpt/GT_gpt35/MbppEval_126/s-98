I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''

    # Find the smaller of the two numbers
    if a > b:
        smaller = b
    else:
        smaller = a
        
    # Initialize the sum variable
    sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over all the possible divisors of the smaller number
    for i in range(1, smaller+1):
        # If the current number is a divisor of both a and b, add it to the sum
        if (a % i == 0) and (b % i == 0):
            sum += i
            
    # Return the sum of the common divisors
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sum(10,20) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
