I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''

    result = 0  # initialize the result variable to 0
    common_divisors = []  # create an empty list to store the common divisors
    
    # iterate through all the numbers from 1 to the minimum of a and b
    for i in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
        # check if both a and b are divisible by i
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            common_divisors.append(i)  # add i to the list of common divisors
    
    # iterate through all the common divisors and add them up
    for divisor in common_divisors:
        result += divisor
    
    return result  # return the sum of common divisors

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sum(10,20) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
