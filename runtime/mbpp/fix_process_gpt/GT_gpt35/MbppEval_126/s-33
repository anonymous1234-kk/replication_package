You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''
 
    # Find the minimum of the two numbers
    minimum = min(a, b)
    
    # Initialize the sum to zero
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number from 1 to minimum
    for i in range(1, minimum+1):
        # Check if both a and b are divisible by i
        if (a % i == 0) and (b % i == 0):
            # If yes, add i to the total_sum
            total_sum += i
    
    # Return the total sum
    return total_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sum(10,20) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
