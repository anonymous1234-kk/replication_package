You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    '''

    """
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
    """
    # Find the smaller number between a and b
    smaller = min(a, b)

    # Initialize sum to zero
    div_sum = 0

    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to the smaller number
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        # If i is a divisor of both a and b, add it to the sum
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            div_sum += i

    # Return the sum of common divisors
    return div_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sum(10,20) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
