You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def difference(n) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def difference(n) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    '''

    sum_of_naturals = 0
    sum_of_cubes = 0

    # Calculating the sum of first n natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum_of_naturals += i

    # Calculating the sum of cubes of first n natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3

    # Return the difference between the sum of cubes and sum of natural numbers
    return sum_of_cubes - sum_of_naturals

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert difference(3.5) == 42.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert difference(3) == 30
assert difference(4) == 90
assert difference(5) == 210
assert difference(6) == 420
assert difference(7) == 756
assert difference(8) == 1260
assert difference(9) == 1980
assert difference(10) == 2970
assert difference(15) == 14280
assert difference(20) == 43890
assert difference(5) == 210
assert difference(10) == 2970
assert difference(4) == 90
assert difference(18) == 29070
assert difference(8) == 1260
assert difference(9) == 1980
assert difference(6) == 420
assert difference(4) == 90
assert difference(5) == 210
assert difference(10) == 2970
assert difference(2) == 6
assert difference(3) == 30
assert difference(-1) == 0
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
