You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def difference(n) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def difference(n) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    '''
  
    sum_n = ((n*(n+1))//2)**2
    sum_cube_n = (n*(n+1)//2)**2
    return sum_cube_n - sum_n

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert difference(3) == 30
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
