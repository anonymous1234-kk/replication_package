You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_samepatterns(colors, patterns):    
    '''
    Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.
    '''
```

```python
def is_samepatterns(colors, patterns):    
    '''
    Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.
    '''

    # Create a dictionary to store the mapping of each color to its corresponding pattern
    color_map = {}

    # Iterate through each color and pattern in the input arrays
    for color, pattern in zip(colors, patterns):
        # If the color has not been seen before, add it to the dictionary
        if color not in color_map:
            color_map[color] = pattern
        # If the color has been seen before but the pattern doesn't match, return False
        elif color_map[color] != pattern:
            return False

    # If all colors and patterns have been checked and no conflicts were found, return True
    return True

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_samepatterns('red,green,green,red','ABBA') == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_samepatterns([],[]) == True
assert is_samepatterns(['Green', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Pink', 'Pink'],['Pattern', 'Pattern', 'Color', 'Color', 'Pattern']) == False
assert is_samepatterns(['Red', 'Green', 'Green'],['Color', 'Color', 'Pattern']) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Certainly! Here is the fixed code:

```python
def is_samepatterns(colors, patterns):    
    '''
    Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.
    '''

    # Create a dictionary to store the mapping of each color to its corresponding pattern
    color_map = {}

    # Split the colors and patterns by comma to create lists
    colors = colors.split(',')
    patterns = patterns.split(',')

    # Iterate through each color and pattern in the input arrays
    for color, pattern in zip(colors, patterns):
        # If the color has not been seen before, add it to the dictionary
        if color not in color_map:
            color_map[color] = pattern
        # If the color has been seen before but the pattern doesn't match, return False
        elif color_map[color] != pattern:
            return False

    # If all colors and patterns have been checked and no conflicts were found, return True
    return True
```
