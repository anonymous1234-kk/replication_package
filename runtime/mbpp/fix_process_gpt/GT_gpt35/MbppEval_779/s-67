I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to count the number of lists within a list. The function should return a dictionary, where every list is turned to a tuple, and the value of the tuple is the number of its occurrences.
    '''
```

                dict1[tuple1] += 1
            else:
                dict1[tuple1] = 1
    return dict1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert unique_sublists([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], 'john', 'mike', [1, 2, 3, 4], 'john']) == {(1, 2, 3): 1, (1, 2): 1, ('j', 'o', 'h', 'n'): 2, ('m', 'i', 'k', 'e'): 1, (1, 2, 3, 4): 1}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
