I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/
    '''
```

    # empty dictionary to store the results
    res = {}
  
    # loop through each tuple in the list
    for ele in test_list:
        # loop through each combination of the tuple
        for i in range(1, len(ele)+1):
            for comb in combinations(ele, i):
                # calculate the sum of the current combination
                s = sum(comb)
                if s in res:
                    # if the sum already exists in the dictionary, append the current combination to its list of tuples
                    res[s].append(comb)
                else:
                    # if the sum is not already in the dictionary, create a new key with the current sum and a list containing the current combination
                    res[s] = [comb]
  
    # return the resulting dictionary
    return res

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_combinations([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)]) == [(5, 7), (4, 8), (7, 11)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
