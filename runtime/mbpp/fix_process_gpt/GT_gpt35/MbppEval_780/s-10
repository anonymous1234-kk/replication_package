I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/
    '''
```

from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/
    '''

    # Get all possible combinations of length 2 from the test_list
    combs = combinations(test_list, 2)
    
    # Create an empty list to store the resulting tuples
    result = []
    
    # Loop through each combination of tuples
    for comb in combs:
        # Get the sum of the two tuples
        s = sum(comb)
        
        # Create a new tuple with the original tuples and their sum
        new_tuple = comb + (s,)
        
        # Append the new tuple to the result list
        result.append(new_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of resulting tuples
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_combinations([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)]) == [(5, 7), (4, 8), (7, 11)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
