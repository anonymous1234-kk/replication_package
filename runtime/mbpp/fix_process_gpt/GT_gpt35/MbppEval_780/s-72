I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/
    '''
```

            # Append the current combination and its sum to the result list

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_combinations([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)]) == [(5, 7), (4, 8), (7, 11)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
