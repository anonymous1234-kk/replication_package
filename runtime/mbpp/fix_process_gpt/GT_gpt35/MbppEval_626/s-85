You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''

    # calculate the diameter of the semicircle
    diameter = 2 * r
    # calculate the height of the triangle inscribed in the semicircle
    height = r
    # calculate the base of the triangle inscribed in the semicircle
    base = math.sqrt(diameter ** 2 - height ** 2)
    # calculate the area of the triangle
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    return area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(7) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
