You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
    # The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is an equilateral triangle.
    # The height of the equilateral triangle is equal to the radius of the semicircle.
    # The base of the equilateral triangle is twice the radius of the semicircle.
    # So, the area of the largest triangle inscribed in the semicircle is (sqrt(3)/4) * (2*r)^2 = (sqrt(3)/2) * r^2.

    return (0.5 * r * r * 3**0.5)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(7) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
