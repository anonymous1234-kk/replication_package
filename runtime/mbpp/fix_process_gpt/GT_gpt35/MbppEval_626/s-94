You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
    # Calculate the radius of the inscribed circle of the triangle
    in_radius = r * 0.5
    
    # Calculate the height of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem
    height = ((r ** 2) - (in_radius ** 2)) ** 0.5
    
    # Calculate the base of the triangle
    base = in_radius * 2
    
    # Calculate the area of the triangle
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    
    return area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(7) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
