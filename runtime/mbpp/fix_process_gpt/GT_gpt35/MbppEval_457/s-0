You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def Find_Min(lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def Find_Min(lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length.
    '''

    min_length = float('inf') # initialize min_length to infinity
    min_sublist = [] # initialize an empty list to store the sublist with minimum length

    # iterate through all the sublists of lst
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            sublist = lst[i:j+1]
            sublist_length = len(sublist)

            # update the min_length and min_sublist if sublist has minimum length so far
            if sublist_length < min_length:
                min_length = sublist_length
                min_sublist = sublist

    return min_sublist

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert Find_Min(['apple', 'mango', 'banana', 'kiwi']) == kiwi
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
