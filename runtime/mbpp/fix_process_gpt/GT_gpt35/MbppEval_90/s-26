You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def len_log(list1):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def len_log(list1):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word.
    '''

    # Split the list into individual words.
    words = list1.split()
    # Use the max() function to get the longest word and len() function to find its length.
    return len(max(words, key=len))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert len_log(['python', 'progrmming', 'is', 'fun']) == 10
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
