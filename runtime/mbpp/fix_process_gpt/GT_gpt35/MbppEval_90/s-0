You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def len_log(list1):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def len_log(list1):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word.
    '''

    # Split the list into a list of words
    words = list1.split()
    
    # Initialize a variable to store the length of the longest word
    max_len = 0
    
    # Loop through each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # If the length of the current word is greater than the current max length
        if len(word) > max_len:
            # Update the max length to the length of the current word
            max_len = len(word)
    
    # Return the max length
    return max_len

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert len_log(['python', 'progrmming', 'is', 'fun']) == 10
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
