I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''
 
    sum1 = 1 # initialize the sum of divisors of first number to 1 (as 1 is always a divisor)
    sum2 = 1 # initialize the sum of divisors of second number to 1 (as 1 is always a divisor)
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))+1): 
        if n % i == 0: # if i is a divisor of n
            sum1 += i # add i to the sum of divisors of first number
            if n//i != i: # if i is not the square root of n
                sum1 += n//i # add n/i to the sum of divisors of first number
            # do the same for the second number
            m = n + 1 - i
            if m % i == 0:
                sum2 += i
                if m//i != i:
                    sum2 += m//i
    
    return sum1 == sum2 # return True if the sum of divisors of the two numbers are equal, else False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert div_sum(6) == 6
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
