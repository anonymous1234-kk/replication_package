You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''

    # Find all divisors of n and add them together
    sum_n = sum([i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0])
    
    # Find all divisors of the sum of divisors of n and add them together
    sum_div_n = sum([i for i in range(1, sum_n+1) if sum_n % i == 0])
    
    # Find all divisors of twice the original number and add them together
    sum_2n = sum([i for i in range(1, 2*n+1) if (2*n) % i == 0])
    
    # If the sum of divisors of twice the original number is equal to the sum of divisors of n, return True
    # Otherwise, return False
    return sum_div_n == sum_2n

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert div_sum(6) == 6
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
