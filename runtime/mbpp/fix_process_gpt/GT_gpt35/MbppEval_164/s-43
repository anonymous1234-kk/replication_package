You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''

    # find all the divisors of n and calculate their sum
    sum_n = sum([i for i in range(1, n+1) if n % i == 0])

    # find all the divisors of sum_n and calculate their sum
    sum_div_sum_n = sum([i for i in range(1, sum_n+1) if sum_n % i == 0])

    # find all the divisors of the sum of n and sum_div_sum_n and calculate their sum
    result = sum([i for i in range(1, n+sum_n+sum_div_sum_n+1) if (n+sum_n+sum_div_sum_n) % i == 0])

    # check if the sum of divisors of n and sum_div_sum_n are equal
    if result == n+sum_n+sum_div_sum_n:
        return True
    else:
        return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert div_sum(6) == 6
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
