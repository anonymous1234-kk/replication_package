I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # Define a list to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequence up to each index
    dp = [0] * n
  
    # Initialize the first element of the list with the value of the first element in the array
    dp[0] = a[0]
  
    # Loop through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Check if the current element is greater than the element at the previous index
        if a[i] > a[i-1]:
            # If yes, add the value of the current element to the maximum sum up to the previous index
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i]
        else:
            # If not, the maximum sum up to the current index is the value of the current element
            dp[i] = a[i]
  
    # Initialize the maximum sum with the value of the kth element
    max_sum = a[k]
  
    # Loop through the array starting from the kth element
    for i in range(k):
        # If the current element is less than the kth element and the maximum sum up to the current index plus the value of the kth element is greater than the current maximum sum, update the maximum sum
        if a[i] < a[k] and dp[i] + a[k] > max_sum:
            max_sum = dp[i] + a[k]
  
    # Return the maximum sum
    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
