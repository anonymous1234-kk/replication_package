You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # Initialize an empty list to store the max sum of increasing subsequences
    dp = [0] * n
    # Initialize the first element of dp array with the value of the first element of a
    dp[0] = a[0]

    # Loop through the array a from the second element to the kth element
    for i in range(1, k):
        # Loop through the array a from the first element to i
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current element is greater than the previous element
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                # Update the max sum of increasing subsequence ending at the current index
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])

    # Loop through the array a from the kth element to the (index+1)th element
    for i in range(k, index+1):
        # Loop through the array a from the first element to i
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current element is greater than the previous element
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                # Update the max sum of increasing subsequence ending at the current index
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])

    # Return the max sum of increasing subsequence ending at the index and including k
    return dp[index] + a[k]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([2, 5, 1, 8, 3],5,2,3) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],7,0,4) == 101
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10],6,0,3) == 120
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],7,0,6) == 6
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = a[0]

    for i in range(1, k):

                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])

    for i in range(k, index+1):
        for j in range(i):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])

    return dp[index] + a[k]
