You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # Initialize max_sum to 0
    max_sum = 0

    # Iterate from 0 to k
    for i in range(k):
        # If the current element is greater than the element at the given index and its sum is greater than the current maximum sum, update the maximum sum
        if a[i] > a[index] and max_sum < max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, i, k):
            max_sum = max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, i, k)

    # Add the value at the given index to the maximum sum
    max_sum += a[index]

    # Return the maximum sum
    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
