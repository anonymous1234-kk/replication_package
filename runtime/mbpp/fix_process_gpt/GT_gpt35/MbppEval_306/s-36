I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # Initialize an array to hold the maximum sum of increasing subsequence up to index i
    # and including element a[i]
    dp = [a[i] if i <= index else float('-inf') for i in range(n)]
    
    # Iterate over the elements after index i up to k
    for i in range(index+1, k):
        # For each element, iterate over all the previous elements up to index i
        # and update the maximum sum of increasing subsequence with that element
        for j in range(index, i):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + a[i])
    
    # Return the maximum sum of increasing subsequence up to index i
    # and including element a[k]
    return max(dp[i] + a[k] for i in range(k) if i <= index)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([2, 5, 1, 8, 3],5,2,3) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],7,0,4) == 101
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10],6,0,3) == 120
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],7,0,6) == 6
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
