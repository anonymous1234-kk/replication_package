You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # initialize max sum to 0
    max_sum = 0
    
    # for each index from 0 to k (inclusive), find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including the kth element
    for i in range(k+1):
        # initialize sum to the value of kth element if i is less than or equal to index, else 0
        sum = a[k] if i <= index else 0
        
        # for each j from 0 to i (inclusive), if jth element is less than kth element and jth element is greater than or equal to ith element, add jth element to sum
        for j in range(i):
            if a[j] < a[k] and a[j] >= a[i]:
                sum += a[j]
        
        # update max sum if sum is greater than max sum
        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum)
    
    # return max sum
    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    for i in range(k+1):

        for j in range(i):

        max_sum = max(max_sum, sum)

    return max_sum
