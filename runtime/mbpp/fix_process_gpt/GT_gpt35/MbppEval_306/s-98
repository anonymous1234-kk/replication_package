I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    dp = [0] * n
    dp[index] = a[index]
    for i in range(index+1, n):
        if a[i] > a[index]:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[index] + a[i])
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i+1, k):
            if a[j] > a[i]:
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + a[j])
    return max(dp)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],7,0,4) == 101
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
