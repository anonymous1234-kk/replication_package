I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

    '''
    # Initialize the maximum sum to be the value of the element at index i
    max_sum = a[index]
    
    # Initialize the current sum to be the value of the element at index i
    curr_sum = a[index]
    
    # Iterate from i+1 to k (inclusive)
    for i in range(index+1, k+1):
        # If the current element is greater than the previous element
        if a[i] > a[index]:
            # Add it to the current sum
            curr_sum += a[i]
            
            # If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum
            if curr_sum > max_sum:
                # Update the maximum sum
                max_sum = curr_sum
    
    # Return the maximum sum
    return max_sum

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
