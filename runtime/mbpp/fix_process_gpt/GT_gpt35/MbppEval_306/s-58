I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # Initialize an array to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequence until ith index
    dp = [0] * n
  
    # Set the maximum sum to the value of the ith element
    dp[index] = a[index]
  
    # Iterate over the array starting from i+1 to k
    for i in range(index + 1, k):
        # Iterate over the array from 0 to i and find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence
        for j in range(i):
            if a[i] > a[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j])
  
        # Add the value of the ith element to the maximum sum
        dp[i] += a[i]
  
    # Find the maximum sum from the dp array
    max_sum = max(dp)
  
    # Return the maximum sum
    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
