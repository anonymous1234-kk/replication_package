I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(a, n, index, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i, i.e., k > i .
    '''

    # Initializing dp and setting the maximum sum as the value of the element at the given index
    dp = [a[index] for i in range(n)]
    # Iterating from the given index until the end of the array
    for i in range(index+1, n):
        # Checking if the current element is greater than the element at the given index
        if a[i] > a[index]:
            # Updating the dp value for the current index
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[index]+a[i])
    # Adding the value of the given kth element, if it is greater than the element at the given index
    if k > index and a[k] > a[index]:
        dp[k] = max(dp[k], dp[index]+a[k])
    # Returning the maximum value in the dp array
    return max(dp)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5],7,0,4) == 101
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([3, 4, 5, 10],4,0,3) == 13
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
