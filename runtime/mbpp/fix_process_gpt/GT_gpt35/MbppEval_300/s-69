You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize count to 1 since an empty sequence is also valid
    count = 1
    
    # Loop through all possible sum values of n bits, from 0 to n
    for i in range(n + 1):
        # Calculate the number of ways to choose i bits to be 1
        # and n-i bits to be 0 in the first n bits
        first_half = factorial(n) // (factorial(i) * factorial(n-i))
        
        # Calculate the number of ways to choose i bits to be 1
        # and n-i bits to be 0 in the last n bits
        second_half = factorial(n) // (factorial(i) * factorial(n-i))
        
        # Multiply the two counts to get the total number of valid sequences
        count += first_half * second_half
    
    return count
```

Note that the implementation uses the `factorial` function from the `math` module, so you should include the following import statement at the top of your code:

```python
from math import factorial

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
from math import factorial

def count_binary_seq(n): 
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    
    count = 1
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        first_half = factorial(2*n) // (factorial(n) * factorial(n+i))
        second_half = factorial(2*n) // (factorial(n) * factorial(n-i))
        count += first_half * second_half
    
    return count
```
