I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all binary sequences of length 2n
    for i in range(2**(2*n)):
        # Convert the number to a binary string
        binary_string = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)
        
        # Split the binary string into two halves
        first_half = binary_string[:n]
        second_half = binary_string[n:]
        
        # Compute the sum of each half
        sum_first_half = sum(int(bit) for bit in first_half)
        sum_second_half = sum(int(bit) for bit in second_half)
        
        # If the sums are equal, increment the count
        if sum_first_half == sum_second_half:
            count += 1
    
    # Return the final count
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
