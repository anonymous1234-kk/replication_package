I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Calculate the number of binary sequences of length n with k ones
    def binomial_coeff(n, k):
        if k < 0 or k > n:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(k):
            res *= (n - i)
            res //= (i + 1)
        return res

    # Calculate the number of binary sequences of length n with sum s
    def count_sequences(n, s):
        return binomial_coeff(n, (n + s) // 2)

    # Count the number of binary sequences of length 2n with the property described in the question
    count = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        count += count_sequences(n, i) * count_sequences(n, i)
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
