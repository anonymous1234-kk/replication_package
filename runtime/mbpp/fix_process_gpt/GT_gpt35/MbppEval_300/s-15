You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    """
    This function takes an integer 'n' as input and finds the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that 
    sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    """
    if n == 0: # if n is 0, return 1 as there is only 1 sequence possible in this case
        return 1
    else:
        # we can either put 0 or 1 at the ith position of the sequence
        # we need to find the count of all sequences such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits
        # for each i, we need to consider two cases, either we put 0 or 1 at ith position of the sequence
        count = 0
        for i in range(2):
            count += count_binary_seq(n - 1) # recursively call count_binary_seq with n-1
        return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
