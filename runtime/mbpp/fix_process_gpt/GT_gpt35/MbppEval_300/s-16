I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
 
    def countSeqUtil(dp, n, diff, sum): 
        if (n == 0): 
            return diff == 0
  
        if (dp[n][diff][sum] != -1): 
            return dp[n][diff][sum] 
  
        ans = countSeqUtil(dp, n - 1, diff + 1 if sum == 0 else diff - 1, sum + 1) + \
              countSeqUtil(dp, n - 1, diff - 1 if sum == 0 else diff + 1, sum + 1) 
        dp[n][diff][sum] = ans 
  
        return ans 
  
    dp = [[[-1 for i in range(2 * n + 1)] for j in range(2 * n)] for k in range(2)] 
    return countSeqUtil(dp, n, 0, 0)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
