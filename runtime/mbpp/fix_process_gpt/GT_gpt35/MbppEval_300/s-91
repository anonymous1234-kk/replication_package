I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
    # Total number of binary sequences with length 2n
    total_count = 2**(2*n)

    # Count of binary sequences where sum of first n bits is equal to sum of last n bits
    count = 0

    # Loop over all possible binary sequences
    for i in range(total_count):
        # Convert the integer i to binary representation
        binary_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)

        # Calculate the sum of first n bits and last n bits
        sum_first_n_bits = sum(map(int, binary_str[:n]))
        sum_last_n_bits = sum(map(int, binary_str[n:]))

        # Check if sum of first n bits is equal to sum of last n bits
        if sum_first_n_bits == sum_last_n_bits:
            count += 1

    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
