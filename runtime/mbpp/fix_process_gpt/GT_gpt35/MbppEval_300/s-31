You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    def count_binary_seq_helper(n, sum_so_far, memo):
        if n == 0:
            return 1 if sum_so_far == 0 else 0
        if (n, sum_so_far) in memo:
            return memo[(n, sum_so_far)]
        count = count_binary_seq_helper(n-1, sum_so_far+1, memo) + count_binary_seq_helper(n-1, sum_so_far-1, memo)
        memo[(n, sum_so_far)] = count
        return count
    
    memo = {}
    return count_binary_seq_helper(n, 0, memo)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
