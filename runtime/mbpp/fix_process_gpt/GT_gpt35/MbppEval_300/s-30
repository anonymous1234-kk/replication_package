You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''

    '''
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(2**(2*n - 1)):
        binary = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n - 1)
        first_half_sum = sum(int(c) for c in binary[:n])
        second_half_sum = sum(int(c) for c in binary[n:])
        if first_half_sum == second_half_sum:
            count += 1
    
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    count = [0]
    backtrack('', 0, 0, count)
    return count[0]
```
