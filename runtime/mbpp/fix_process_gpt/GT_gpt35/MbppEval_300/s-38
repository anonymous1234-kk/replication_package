I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
 
    # There are only two possible values for each bit in a binary sequence: 0 or 1.
    # So, we need to iterate over all possible sequences of length 2n with n 0's and n 1's.
    # For each sequence, we need to calculate the sum of the first n bits and the sum of the last n bits.
    # If the two sums are equal, we increment the count by 1.
    
    count = 0
    
    # iterate over all possible sequences of length 2n with n 0's and n 1's.
    for seq in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=2*n):
        
        # calculate the sum of the first n bits and the sum of the last n bits.
        first_half = sum(seq[:n])
        second_half = sum(seq[n:])
        
        # If the two sums are equal, we increment the count by 1.
        if first_half == second_half:
            count += 1
    
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
import itertools

def count_binary_seq(n): 
    count = 0
    
    for seq in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=2*n):
        first_half = sum(seq[:n])
        second_half = sum(seq[n:])
        
        if first_half == second_half:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
