You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    """
    Find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.

    Args:
    n : int : length of binary sequence

    Returns:
    int : count of binary sequences
    """
    def count_sequences(n, zeros, ones):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        elif zeros == ones:
            return 2 * count_sequences(n-1, zeros+1, ones)
        else:
            return count_sequences(n-1, zeros+1, ones) + count_sequences(n-1, zeros, ones+1)

    return count_sequences(n, 0, 0)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
