You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    def count_seq_helper(l, r):
        if l == 0 and r == 0:
            return 1
        if l < r:
            return 0
        res = 0
        if l > 0:
            res += count_seq_helper(l - 1, r)
        if r > 0:
            res += count_seq_helper(l, r - 1)
        return res

    return count_seq_helper(n, n)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

        if l == 0 and r == 0:

        if l < r:
            return 0
        if memo[l][r] != -1:
            return memo[l][r]
        res = 0
        if l > 0:
            res += count_seq_helper(l - 1, r, memo)
        if r > 0:
            res += count_seq_helper(l, r - 1, memo)
        memo[l][r] = res

    memo = [[-1] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    return count_seq_helper(n, n, memo)
```
