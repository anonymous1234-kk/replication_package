I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # The total number of sequences where sum of first n bits is equal to sum of last n bits is given by the
    # binomial coefficient (2n choose n). 
    # This is the number of ways to choose n positions in a sequence of 2n positions.
    # So we just need to compute this value and return it.
    return int(factorial(2*n) / (factorial(n)**2))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
from math import factorial

def count_binary_seq(n): 
    return int(factorial(2*n) / (factorial(n)**2))
```
