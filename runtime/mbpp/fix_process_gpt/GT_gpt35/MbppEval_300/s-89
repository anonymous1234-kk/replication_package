You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Number of binary sequences with equal sum of first and last n bits is 2^n.
    # We can get the required binary sequences by selecting n bits out of 2n bits to have a value of 1, which means the remaining n bits will have a value of 0.
    # The total number of ways to select n bits out of 2n bits is (2n choose n) or (2n)! / (n! * (2n - n)!).
    return math.comb(2 * n, n)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
import math

def count_binary_seq(n): 
    return math.comb(2 * n, n)
```
