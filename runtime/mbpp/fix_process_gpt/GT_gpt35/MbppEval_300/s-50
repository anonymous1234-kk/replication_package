I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Initialize a variable to hold the count of binary sequences.
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible binary sequences of length 2n.
    for i in range(2**(2*n)):
        # Convert the integer i to binary string and pad with leading zeros.
        binary_str = format(i, f'0{2*n}b')
        
        # Get the sum of first n bits and last n bits.
        first_half_sum = sum(int(x) for x in binary_str[:n])
        second_half_sum = sum(int(x) for x in binary_str[n:])
        
        # If the sum of first n bits is equal to the sum of last n bits, increment the count.
        if first_half_sum == second_half_sum:
            count += 1
    
    # Return the count of binary sequences.
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
