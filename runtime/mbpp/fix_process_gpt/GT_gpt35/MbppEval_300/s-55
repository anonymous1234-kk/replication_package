I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Initialize the count to 1, as the empty sequence is a valid binary sequence
    count = 1

    # Loop through all possible sums of n bits
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # For each sum, there are n choose i ways to choose the bits that will sum up to that value
        count += binomial_coefficient(n, i)

    # The total count is the count for all possible sums of n bits
    # multiplied by the count for all possible sums of the remaining n bits
    return count * count


# Helper function to calculate binomial coefficient
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate n choose k using dynamic programming
    # Initialize the dp array with 0's
    dp = [0] * (k+1)
    dp[0] = 1

    # Calculate the binomial coefficient using the formula
    # n choose k = (n-i+1)/i * (n-i+2)/(i-1) * ... * (n-k+1)/1
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (n-i+1) // i

    return dp[k]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
