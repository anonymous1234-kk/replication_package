I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Number of binary sequences where sum of first n bits is x
    # and sum of last n bits is y
    dp = [[0 for j in range(n + 1)] for i in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Fill up the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1):
            if j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j + 1]
            elif j == i:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j + 1]

    # Return the total count of binary sequences
    return dp[n][0]
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The `dp` matrix is initialized to all zeros, and `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary sequences of length `2i` where the sum of the first `i` bits is `j`.

The recurrence relation used to fill up the `dp` matrix is as follows:

```
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j + 1], if 1 <= j < i
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j + 1], if j == 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1], if j == i

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
