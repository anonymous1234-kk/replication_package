You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # The total number of binary sequences is 2^(2n) since we have 2n bits
    total = 2**(2*n)
    
    # The number of binary sequences where the sum of first n bits is not equal to sum of last n bits
    not_valid = 0
    
    # Iterate through each binary sequence of length 2n
    for i in range(total):
        # Convert the decimal number to binary of length 2n
        binary = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)
        
        # Split the binary number into two parts
        first_n_bits = binary[:n]
        last_n_bits = binary[n:]
        
        # Calculate the sum of the first n bits and the last n bits
        sum_first_n_bits = sum(int(bit) for bit in first_n_bits)
        sum_last_n_bits = sum(int(bit) for bit in last_n_bits)
        
        # If the sum of the first n bits is not equal to sum of last n bits, increment the not_valid counter
        if sum_first_n_bits != sum_last_n_bits:
            not_valid += 1
    
    # The number of valid binary sequences is the total number of binary sequences minus the number of not valid binary sequences
    valid = total - not_valid
    
    # Return the number of valid binary sequences
    return valid

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
