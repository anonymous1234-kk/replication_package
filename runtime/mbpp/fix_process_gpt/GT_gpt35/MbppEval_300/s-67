You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
 
    def countBinarySeqUtil(m, diff, dp): 
        if abs(diff) > m: 
            return 0
        
        if m == 0 and diff == 0: 
            return 1

        if dp[m][diff + n] != -1: 
            return dp[m][diff + n] 
        
        res = countBinarySeqUtil(m - 1, diff + 1, dp) + countBinarySeqUtil(m - 1, diff - 1, dp) 

        dp[m][diff + n] = res 

        return res 

    dp = [[-1 for i in range(2*n)] for j in range(n + 1)] 
    return countBinarySeqUtil(n, 0, dp)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
