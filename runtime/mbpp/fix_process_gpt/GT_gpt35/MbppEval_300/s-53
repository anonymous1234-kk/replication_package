You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

    '''
    # Total number of sequences for given n
    total_sequences = 2**(2*n) 
    
    # Number of sequences where sum of first n bits is equal to sum of last n bits
    valid_sequences = 0 
    
    # Iterate through all the sequences and count the valid ones
    for i in range(total_sequences):
        # Convert the integer to binary string with 2n bits
        binary_string = format(i, f'0{2*n}b')
        
        # Count the number of 0's and 1's in first n bits and last n bits
        sum_first_n_bits = binary_string[:n].count('1')
        sum_last_n_bits = binary_string[n:].count('1')
        
        # If the sum of first n bits is equal to sum of last n bits, increment valid_sequences counter
        if sum_first_n_bits == sum_last_n_bits:
            valid_sequences += 1
    
    return valid_sequences

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
