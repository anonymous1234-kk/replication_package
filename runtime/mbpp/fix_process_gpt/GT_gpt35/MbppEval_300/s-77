You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
    # Calculate the total number of binary sequences of length 2n
    total = 2**(2*n)

    # Calculate the number of binary sequences such that the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits
    count = 0
    for i in range(total):
        # Convert the number to binary string and pad it with leading zeros to get a length of 2n
        binary_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)
        # Calculate the sum of the first n bits and last n bits
        first_half = sum(int(bit) for bit in binary_str[:n])
        last_half = sum(int(bit) for bit in binary_str[n:])
        # If both sums are equal, increment the count
        if first_half == last_half:
            count += 1

    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Certainly! Here is the fixed code:

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Calculate the total number of binary sequences of length 2n
    total = 2**(2*n)

    # Calculate the number of binary sequences such that the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits
    count = 0
    for i in range(total):
        # Convert the number to binary string and pad it with leading zeros to get a length of 2n
        binary_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)
        # Calculate the sum of the first n bits and last n bits
        first_half = sum(int(bit) for bit in binary_str[:n])
        last_half = sum(int(bit) for bit in binary_str[n:])
        # If both sums are equal, increment the count
        if first_half == last_half:
            count += 1

    return float(count)

```
