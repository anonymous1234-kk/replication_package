I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def extract_freq(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def extract_freq(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list.
    '''

    # Using set to remove duplicates from the list of tuples
    unique_tuples = set(test_list)
    
    # Returning the count of unique tuples
    return len(unique_tuples)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert extract_freq([(1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (2, 1)]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert extract_freq([(0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 5)]) == 2
assert extract_freq([(0, 5), (0, 7)]) == 2
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Fixed code:

    '''
    Write a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list.
    '''

    # Using set to remove duplicates from the list of tuples
    unique_tuples = set(test_list)
    
    # Counting the frequency of each unique tuple in the list
    freq_count = {}
    for tuple_ in unique_tuples:
        if tuple_ in freq_count:
            freq_count[tuple_] += 1
        else:
            freq_count[tuple_] = 1
    
    # Counting the number of unique tuples with frequency greater than 1
    count = 0
    for freq in freq_count.values():
        if freq > 1:
            count += 1
    
    # Returning the count of unique tuples with frequency greater than 1
    return count
```
