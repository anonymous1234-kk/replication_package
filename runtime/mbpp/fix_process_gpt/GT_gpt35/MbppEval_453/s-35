You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def sumofFactors(n) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import math 
def sumofFactors(n) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number.
    '''
 
    # Initialize result
    res = 0
  
    # Find all divisors of n and add them
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if (n % i == 0):
            # If i is even
            if (i % 2 == 0):
                res += i
            # If n/i is even and i is not equal to n/i
            if ((n/i) % 2 == 0 and i != n/i):
                res += int(n/i)
  
    # Add 1 and n to result as they are also divisors of n
    if (n % 2 == 0):
        res += 1
        res += n
  
    # Return the final result
    return res

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sumofFactors(30) == 48
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
