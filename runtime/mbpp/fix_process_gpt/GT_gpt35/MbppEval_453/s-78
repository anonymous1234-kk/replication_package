You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def sumofFactors(n) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number.
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def sumofFactors(n) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of even factors of a number.
    '''
 
    # Initializing the sum variable to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Checking for all factors from 2 to square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1) :
        if (n % i == 0) :
            # If the factor is even, add it to the sum
            if (i % 2 == 0) :
                sum += i
                
            # If the factor is odd and its corresponding even factor is less than square root of n, add it to the sum
            if ((n/i) % 2 == 0 and (n/i) != i) :
                sum += int(n/i)
                
    # Return the sum of even factors
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sumofFactors(30) == 48
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
