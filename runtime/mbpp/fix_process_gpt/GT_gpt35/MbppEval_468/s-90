I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize the array to store the maximum product ending at each index
    max_product_end = [0] * n

    # Initialize the maximum product and the corresponding sequence
    max_product = float('-inf')
    max_sequence = []

    # Iterate through each index of the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize the maximum product ending at the current index to be the value of the current element
        max_product_end[i] = arr[i]

        # Iterate through each index before the current index
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current element is greater than the previous element and the product of the maximum product ending at the previous index and the current element is greater than the maximum product ending at the current index, update the maximum product ending at the current index
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and max_product_end[j] * arr[i] > max_product_end[i]:
                max_product_end[i] = max_product_end[j] * arr[i]

        # If the maximum product ending at the current index is greater than the maximum product found so far, update the maximum product and the corresponding sequence
        if max_product_end[i] > max_product:
            max_product = max_product_end[i]
            max_sequence = [arr[i]]

        # If the maximum product ending at the current index is equal to the maximum product found so far, append the current element to the corresponding sequence
        elif max_product_end[i] == max_product:
            max_sequence.append(arr[i])

    # Return the maximum product and the corresponding sequence
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
