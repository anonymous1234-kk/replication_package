I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize an array to store the maximum product ending at each position
    max_ending_here = [0] * n
    # Initialize an array to store the minimum product ending at each position
    min_ending_here = [0] * n
    # Initialize the first element of both arrays to the first element of the input array
    max_ending_here[0] = min_ending_here[0] = arr[0]
    # Traverse through the input array
    for i in range(1, n):
        # If the current element is positive, update the maximum product ending at the current position
        if arr[i] > 0:
            max_ending_here[i] = max(arr[i], arr[i] * max_ending_here[i-1])
            min_ending_here[i] = min(arr[i], arr[i] * min_ending_here[i-1])
        # If the current element is negative, update the maximum product ending at the current position
        else:
            max_ending_here[i] = max(arr[i], arr[i] * min_ending_here[i-1])
            min_ending_here[i] = min(arr[i], arr[i] * max_ending_here[i-1])
    # Return the maximum product obtained by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence
    return max(max_ending_here)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
