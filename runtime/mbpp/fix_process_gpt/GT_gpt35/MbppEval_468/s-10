I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize two lists to store the maximum product
    # and the maximum value of the increasing subsequence
    max_prod = [arr[0]]
    max_val = [arr[0]]
    # Iterate over the input array
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Initialize the maximum product and maximum value
        # for the current element
        cur_max_prod = arr[i]
        cur_max_val = arr[i]
        # Iterate over the previous elements
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current element is greater than the previous
            # element and the product of the current element and the
            # maximum value of the previous increasing subsequence
            # is greater than the current maximum product
            if arr[j] < arr[i] and arr[i]*max_val[j] > cur_max_prod:
                # Update the current maximum product and maximum value
                cur_max_prod = arr[i]*max_val[j]
                cur_max_val = max_val[j]
        # Update the maximum product and maximum value for the
        # current element
        max_prod.append(cur_max_prod)
        max_val.append(cur_max_val)
    # Return the maximum product of an increasing subsequence
    return max(max_prod)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
