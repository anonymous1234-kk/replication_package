I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
   
    n = len(arr) 
    # Initialize an empty list to store the maximum product of each increasing subsequence ending at index i
    max_product_arr = [0] * n  
    # Initialize the max product as the first element in the array
    max_product_arr[0] = arr[0]   
    # Traverse the array from the second element
    for i in range(1, n):   
        # Initialize the current max product as the current element
        current_max_product = arr[i]   
        # Check all the previous elements in the array
        for j in range(i):   
            # Check if the current element is greater than the previous element
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:   
                # Update the current max product by multiplying the current element with the maximum product ending at the previous element
                current_max_product = max(current_max_product, arr[i] * max_product_arr[j])   
        # Update the maximum product array with the current max product
        max_product_arr[i] = current_max_product   
    # Return the maximum product from the maximum product array
    return max(max_product_arr)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
