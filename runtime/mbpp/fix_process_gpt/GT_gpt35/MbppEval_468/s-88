I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return "Array length should be at least 2"
    dp = [[0 for x in range(n)] for y in range(n)]
    max_product = float("-inf")
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = arr[i]
        max_product = max(max_product, dp[i][i])
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(n-length+1):
            j = i + length - 1
            for k in range(i, j):
                if arr[k] < arr[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k]*arr[j])
            max_product = max(max_product, dp[i][j])
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
