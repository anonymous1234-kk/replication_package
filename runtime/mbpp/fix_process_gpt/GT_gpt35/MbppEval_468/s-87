I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
   
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the array to store the maximum product so far at each index.
    # Initially, the maximum product at each index is the value of the element itself.
    max_product = arr.copy()
    # Initialize the array to store the previous index of the maximum element
    prev_max_index = [-1] * n

    # Iterate over the array to compute the maximum product at each index
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            # Check if the current element is greater than the previous element
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                # Compute the product of the current element and the maximum product at the previous index
                product = arr[i] * max_product[j]
                # Update the maximum product if the computed product is greater than the current maximum product at the current index
                if product > max_product[i]:
                    max_product[i] = product
                    prev_max_index[i] = j

    # Find the index of the maximum element in the max_product array
    max_product_index = max(range(n), key=lambda i: max_product[i])
    subsequence = []

    # Traverse the prev_max_index array to find the increasing subsequence of numbers that yields the maximum product
    while max_product_index != -1:
        subsequence.append(arr[max_product_index])
        max_product_index = prev_max_index[max_product_index]

    # Reverse the subsequence to get the increasing subsequence of numbers
    subsequence.reverse()

    # Return the maximum product and the increasing subsequence that yields the maximum product
    return max(max_product), subsequence

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
