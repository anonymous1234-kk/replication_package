I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the maximum product to be 0
    max_product = 0
    # Initialize a list to store the maximum product up to each index
    max_product_list = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize the maximum product for this index to be the current value
        max_here = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current value is greater than the previous value and the max product up to that index multiplied
            # by the current value is greater than the current maximum product for this index, update the maximum product
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and max_product_list[j] * arr[i] > max_here:
                max_here = max_product_list[j] * arr[i]
        # Update the maximum product list for this index
        max_product_list[i] = max_here
        # If the maximum product for this index is greater than the overall maximum product, update the overall maximum product
        if max_here > max_product:
            max_product = max_here
    
    # Return the overall maximum product
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
