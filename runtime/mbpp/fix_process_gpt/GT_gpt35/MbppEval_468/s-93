I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize an array to store the maximum product values
    max_product = [0] * n
    # Initialize the first value to be the first element of the array
    max_product[0] = arr[0]

    # Loop through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Initialize the maximum product to be the current element
        max_val = arr[i]
        # Loop through the previous elements and find the maximum product
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current element is greater than the previous element,
            # update the maximum product
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                max_val = max(max_val, max_product[j] * arr[i])
        # Store the maximum product for the current element in the array
        max_product[i] = max_val

    # Return the maximum product from the array
    return max(max_product)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
