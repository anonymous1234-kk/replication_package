I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the array for storing the maximum product values
    max_val = [0] * n
    # Initialize the array for storing the indexes of previous elements in the increasing subsequence
    prev_idx = [-1] * n

    # Iterate through the array to find the maximum product value
    for i in range(n):
        max_val[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                if max_val[i] < max_val[j] * arr[i]:
                    max_val[i] = max_val[j] * arr[i]
                    prev_idx[i] = j

    # Find the index of the maximum product value
    max_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if max_val[i] > max_val[max_idx]:
            max_idx = i

    # Initialize the result variable and add the maximum product value to it
    result = [arr[max_idx]]
    # Get the indexes of all the elements in the increasing subsequence
    while prev_idx[max_idx] != -1:
        result.append(arr[prev_idx[max_idx]])
        max_idx = prev_idx[max_idx]

    # Reverse the result list to get the increasing subsequence
    result.reverse()

    # Calculate the maximum product value of the increasing subsequence
    max_product = 1
    for val in result:
        max_product *= val

    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
