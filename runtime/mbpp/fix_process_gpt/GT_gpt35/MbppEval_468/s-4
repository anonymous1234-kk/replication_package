I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize the list of maximum products for each index
    max_products = [0] * n

    # Initialize the maximum product value to be the first element of the array
    max_product = arr[0]

    # Loop through the array
    for i in range(n):

        # Initialize the maximum product for this index to be the value of the element
        max_products[i] = arr[i]

        # Loop through the elements before this index
        for j in range(i):

            # If the element before this index is less than the current element,
            # update the maximum product for this index with the product of the
            # current element and the maximum product for the element before this index
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], arr[i] * max_products[j])

        # Update the overall maximum product value
        max_product = max(max_product, max_products[i])

    # Return the maximum product
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
