I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    # Initialize the product table
    product_table = [0] * n
    # For each index i in the array, find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at i
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize the maximum product for subsequence ending at i
        max_product_i = arr[i]
        # Iterate over all indices j < i
        for j in range(i):
            # If arr[j] is less than arr[i] and the product of subsequence ending at j and arr[i] is greater than max_product_i
            if arr[j] < arr[i] and max_product_i < product_table[j] * arr[i]:
                max_product_i = product_table[j] * arr[i]
        # Update the product table for index i
        product_table[i] = max_product_i
    # Return the maximum product in the product table
    return max(product_table)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
