You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return "Not enough elements in array"
    # Initialize the product variable to be the first element in the array
    product = arr[0]
    # Initialize the last element in the increasing subsequence to be the first element in the array
    last = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Check if the current element is greater than the last element in the increasing subsequence
        if arr[i] > last:
            # Update the product variable by multiplying the current element with the last element in the increasing subsequence
            product *= arr[i]
            # Update the last element in the increasing subsequence
            last = arr[i]
    return product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
