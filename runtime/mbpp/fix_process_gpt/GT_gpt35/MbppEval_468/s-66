You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize a list to store the maximum product of each index
    max_product = [0] * n

    # Traverse the array from left to right
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize the maximum product for the current index to the value of the array element
        max_product[i] = arr[i]

        # Check for the increasing subsequence on the left of the current index
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                # If the element is smaller than the current element, update the maximum product for the current index
                max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])

    # Return the maximum product in the array
    return max(max_product)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
