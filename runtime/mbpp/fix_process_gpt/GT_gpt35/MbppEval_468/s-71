You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize a list to store the maximum product of each increasing subsequence ending at index i
    max_product_list = [arr[0]] * n
    # Initialize a variable to store the maximum product overall
    max_product = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_product_list[i] = arr[i]
        # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_product_list[i] = max(max_product_list[i], max_product_list[j] * arr[i])
        # Update the maximum product overall
        max_product = max(max_product, max_product_list[i])
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 196800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
