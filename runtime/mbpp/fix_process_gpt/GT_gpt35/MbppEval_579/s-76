You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_dissimilar(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_dissimilar(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples.
    '''

    # Initializing empty lists to store dissimilar elements
    res1 = []
    res2 = []
  
    # Iterating through the first tuple and checking for dissimilar elements
    for i in test_tup1:
        if i not in test_tup2:
            res1.append(i)
  
    # Iterating through the second tuple and checking for dissimilar elements
    for i in test_tup2:
        if i not in test_tup1:
            res2.append(i)
  
    # Returning the dissimilar elements
    return (res1, res2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_dissimilar((1, 2, 3, 4, 5),(5,)) == (1, 2, 3, 4)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
