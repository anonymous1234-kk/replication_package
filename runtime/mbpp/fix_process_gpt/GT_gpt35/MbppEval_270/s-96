I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(arr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list.
    '''
```

```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(arr):

    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list.
    '''
    return sum(arr[::2][::2])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sum_even_and_even_index([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
