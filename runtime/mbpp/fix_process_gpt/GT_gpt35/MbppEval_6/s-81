You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_Power_Of_Two (x): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def is_Power_Of_Two (x): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
    '''
 
    # A number is a power of 2 if it has only one set bit
    if x == 0:
        return False
    # Check if there is only one bit set in x
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0
```

Note that the implementation above checks whether the given input number is a power of 2 or not. If you want to check whether two numbers differ at one bit position only, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
def differ_at_one_bit_pos(x, y):
    # Find the XOR of the two numbers
    xor = x ^ y
    # Check if there is only one bit set in the XOR
    return (xor & (xor - 1)) == 0

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_Power_Of_Two (7) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def is_Power_Of_Two (x): 
    if x == 0:
        return False
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0

assert is_Power_Of_Two (7) == False
```
