You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
    '''
```

```python
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
    '''

    # Initialize the sum to zero
    sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the range 0 to n+1 with a step of 2 to access even indices
    for i in range(0, n+1, 2):
        # Compute the binomial coefficient using the formula n!/(k!*(n-k)!) where k is i/2
        coef = math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(i//2) * math.factorial(n - (i//2)))
        # Add the coefficient to the sum
        sum += coef
        
    # Return the sum of even index binomial coefficients
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(6) == 32
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(5) == 16
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
