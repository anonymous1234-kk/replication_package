You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
    '''
```

```python
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
    '''

    # Initialize the sum variable to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through values of k from 0 to n/2 (inclusive)
    for k in range(0, n//2 + 1):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient
        coeff = math.comb(n, 2*k)
        
        # If k is even, add the coefficient to the sum
        if k % 2 == 0:
            sum += coeff
    
    # Return the sum of even index binomial coefficients
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(5) == 16
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

        if k % 2 == 0:
            sum += coeff
    
    return sum

assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(5) == 16
