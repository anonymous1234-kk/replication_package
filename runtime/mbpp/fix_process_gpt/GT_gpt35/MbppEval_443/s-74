You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_neg(list1): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the largest negative number from the given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def largest_neg(list1): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the largest negative number from the given list.
    '''

    largest = None  # Initialize largest to None
    for num in list1:  # Loop through each number in the list
        if num < 0 and (largest is None or num > largest):  # Check if the number is negative and is greater than the current largest
            largest = num  # If it is, update the largest variable
    return largest  # Return the largest negative number, or None if no negative number was found

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_neg(['2,3,1,7,8']) == 2,3,1,7,8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def largest_neg(list1): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the largest negative number from the given list.
    '''

    largest = None  # Initialize largest to None
    for num in list1:  # Loop through each number in the list
        if isinstance(num, int) and num < 0 and (largest is None or num > largest):  # Check if the number is negative and is greater than the current largest
            largest = num  # If it is, update the largest variable
    return largest  # Return the largest negative number, or None if no negative number was found
```

Note: The fixed code includes a check to ensure that the elements in the list are integers before comparing them to find the largest negative number.

```python

 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
