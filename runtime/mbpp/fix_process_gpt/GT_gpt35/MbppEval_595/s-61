You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
 
    # Create a counter variable to keep track of the minimum number of swaps required
    counter = 0 

    # Iterate through the length of the string 
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        
        # If the ith character of str1 is not equal to the ith character of str2 
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            
            # Iterate through the remaining characters of str1

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111') == Not Possible
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code that passes the given test case:

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
 
    # Create a counter variable to keep track of the minimum number of swaps required
    counter = 0 

    # Iterate through the length of the string 
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        
        # If the ith character of str1 is not equal to the ith character of str2 
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            
            # Iterate through the remaining characters of str1 
            for j in range(i + 1, len(str1)):
                
                # If the jth character of str1 is equal to the ith character of str2 
                # and the ith character of str1 is equal to the jth character of str2 
                if str1[j] == str2[i] and str1[i] == str2[j]:
                    
                    # Swap the ith and jth characters of str1 
                    str1 = list(str1)
                    str1[i], str1[j] = str1[j], str1[i]
                    str1 = ''.join(str1)
                    
                    # Increment the counter variable
                    counter += 1 
                    break 
            else:
                return "Not Possible"
                    
    # Return the counter variable 
    return counter
```

This fixed code should now pass the given test case as well as the previously passed test cases.
