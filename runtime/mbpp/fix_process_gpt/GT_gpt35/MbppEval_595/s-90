I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
 
    # Count number of mismatches between str1 and str2
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            count += 1
    
    # If count is odd, return -1 as swap is not possible
    if count % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    
    # Count number of pairs to be swapped
    pairs = count // 2
    
    # Return the number of swaps required
    return pairs

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111') == Not Possible
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
