I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

    '''

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111') == Not Possible
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here's the fixed code that passes all the test cases:

```python

    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
    # Find the length of the strings
    n = len(str1)
    
    # Initialize the count of swaps to 0
    swap_count = 0
    
    # Loop through each character of the strings
    for i in range(n):
        
        # If the characters don't match
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            
            # Search for a character in str1 from the i+1th position that matches the ith position in str2
            for j in range(i+1,n):
                if str1[j] == str2[i]:
                    
                    # Swap the characters in str1
                    str1 = str1[:i] + str1[j] + str1[i+1:j] + str1[i] + str1[j+1:]
                    swap_count += 1
                    break
            else:
                return "Not Possible"
    
    # Return the count of swaps
    return swap_count
