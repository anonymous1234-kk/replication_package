I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
 
    # Count number of zeroes and ones in str1 and str2.
    count_0s = count_1s = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] == '0' and str2[i] == '1':
            count_0s += 1
        elif str1[i] == '1' and str2[i] == '0':
            count_1s += 1
    
    # If the number of zeroes and ones are not equal in both strings, return -1.
    if count_0s != count_1s:
        return -1
    
    # Otherwise, return the number of swaps required, which is half the sum of count_0s and count_1s.
    return (count_0s + count_1s) // 2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111') == Not Possible
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Certainly! Here's the updated code:

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
 
    # Count number of zeroes and ones in str1 and str2.
    count_0s = count_1s = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] == '0' and str2[i] == '1':
            count_0s += 1
        elif str1[i] == '1' and str2[i] == '0':
            count_1s += 1
    
    # If the number of zeroes and ones are not equal in both strings, return 'Not Possible'.
    if count_0s != count_1s:
        return 'Not Possible'
    
    # Otherwise, return the number of swaps required, which is half the sum of count_0s and count_1s.
    return (count_0s + count_1s) // 2
```

The updated code will handle the test case `min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111')` correctly, returning `'Not Possible'`.
