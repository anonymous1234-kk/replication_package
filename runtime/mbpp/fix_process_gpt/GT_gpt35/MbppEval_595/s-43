You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''

    # count the number of ones in both the strings
    count1 = count2 = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] == '1':
            count1 += 1
        if str2[i] == '1':
            count2 += 1

    # if the number of ones in both strings is not equal, return -1
    if count1 != count2:
        return -1

    # count the number of swaps required to convert str1 to str2
    swaps = 0
    i = j = 0

        # if the bits are not equal
        if str1[i] != str2[j]:
            # find the next index in str1 where the bit is equal to str2[j]
            k = i + 1
            while k < len(str1) and str1[k] != str2[j]:
                k += 1
            # if such an index is not found, return -1
            if k == len(str1):
                return -1
            # swap the bits
            while k > i:
                str1 = str1[:k-1] + str1[k] + str1[k-1] + str1[k+1:]
                k -= 1
                swaps += 1
        i += 1
        j += 1

    return swaps

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111') == Not Possible
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Apologies for the mistake. Here is the fixed code:

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''

    # count the number of ones in both the strings
    count1 = count2 = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] == '1':
            count1 += 1
        if str2[i] == '1':
            count2 += 1

    # if the number of ones in both strings is not equal, return -1
    if count1 != count2:
        return "Not Possible"

    # count the number of swaps required to convert str1 to str2
    swaps = 0
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):
        # if the bits are not equal
        if str1[i] != str2[j]:
            # find the next index in str1 where the bit is equal to str2[j]
            k = i + 1
            while k < len(str1) and str1[k] != str2[j]:
                k += 1
            # if such an index is not found, return -1
            if k == len(str1):
                return "Not Possible"
            # swap the bits
            while k > i:
                str1 = str1[:k-1] + str1[k] + str1[k-1] + str1[k+1:]
                k -= 1
                swaps += 1
        i += 1
        j += 1

    return swaps
```

Now the code should pass the test case `assert min_Swaps('10101010100101','11111111111111') == "Not Possible"` as well as the previously passed test cases.
