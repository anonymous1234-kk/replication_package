You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def reverse_words(s):
    '''
    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def reverse_words(s):
    '''
    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string.
    '''

    # Split the string into a list of words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Reverse each word in the list
    for i in range(len(words)):
        words[i] = words[i][::-1]
    
    # Join the reversed words and return the new string
    return ' '.join(words)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert reverse_words('A visualized representation of data,') == data, of representation visualized A
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
