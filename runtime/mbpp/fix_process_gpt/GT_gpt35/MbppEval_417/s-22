I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the first elements and their counts
    freq = {}

    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # Extract the first element of the tuple
        elem = tup[0]

        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if elem in freq:
            freq[elem] += 1
        # Otherwise, add the element to the dictionary with a count of 1
        else:
            freq[elem] = 1

    # Create an empty list to store the common elements
    common = []

    # Iterate through the dictionary and add any elements with a count greater than 1 to the common list
    for elem, count in freq.items():
        if count > 1:
            common.append(elem)

    # Return the common list of first elements
    return common

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
