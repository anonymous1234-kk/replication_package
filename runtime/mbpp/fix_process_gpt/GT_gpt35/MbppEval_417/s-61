I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # create a dictionary to hold groups of tuples with the same first element
    groups = defaultdict(list)
    
    # iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        
        # add the tuple to the list associated with its first element in the dictionary
        groups[tup[0]].append(tup)
        
    # create a list of lists, where each sublist contains all tuples with the same first element
    output = [group for group in groups.values()]
    
    # return the list of lists
    return output

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
