You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    group_dict = {}
    for tpl in Input:
        if tpl[0] in group_dict:
            group_dict[tpl[0]].append(tpl)
        else:
            group_dict[tpl[0]] = [tpl]
    return group_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    group_dict = {}
    for tpl in Input:
        if tpl[0] in group_dict:
            group_dict[tpl[0]].append(tpl[1])
        else:
            group_dict[tpl[0]] = [tpl[1]]
    return [(key, *value) for key, value in group_dict.items()]
```
