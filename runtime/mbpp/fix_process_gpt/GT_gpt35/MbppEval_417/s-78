I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the first elements as keys
    # and the corresponding tuples as values
    output_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # If the first element of the tuple is already a key in the dictionary,
        # append the tuple to the list of values for that key
        if tup[0] in output_dict:
            output_dict[tup[0]].append(tup)
        # If the first element of the tuple is not yet a key in the dictionary,
        # add it as a new key with the tuple as its value
        else:
            output_dict[tup[0]] = [tup]
    
    # Convert the dictionary of key-value pairs to a list of tuples
    output_list = [(key, value) for key, value in output_dict.items()]
    
    # Return the list of tuples, sorted by the first element of each tuple
    return sorted(output_list, key=lambda x: x[0])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
