You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    # create an empty dictionary to store the groups
    groups = {}
    
    # iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # extract the first element of the tuple
        key = tup[0]
        # check if the key is already in the dictionary
        if key in groups:
            # if it is, add the tuple to the existing group
            groups[key].append(tup)
        else:
            # if not, create a new group with the tuple
            groups[key] = [tup]
    
    # return the dictionary of groups
    return groups

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
