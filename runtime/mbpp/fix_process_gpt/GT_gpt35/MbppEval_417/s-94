You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the common first element tuples
    common_dict = {}

    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # Check if the first element of the tuple already exists in the dictionary
        if tup[0] in common_dict:
            # If it exists, append the tuple to the list of tuples associated with that first element
            common_dict[tup[0]].append(tup)
        else:
            # If it doesn't exist, create a new list with the current tuple and add it to the dictionary
            common_dict[tup[0]] = [tup]

    # Return the dictionary of common first element tuples
    return common_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    # Initialize an empty list to store the common first element tuples
    common_tuples = []

    # Iterate through the dictionary values
    for tuples_list in common_dict.values():
        # If there is more than one tuple in the list, combine them into a single tuple
        if len(tuples_list) > 1:
            combined_tuple = tuple(item for sublist in tuples_list for item in sublist)
            common_tuples.append(combined_tuple)
        else:
            # If there is only one tuple in the list, add it as it is
            common_tuples.append(tuples_list[0])

    return common_tuples
```
