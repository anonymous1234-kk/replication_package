I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the counts of each first element
    count_dict = {}
    
    # Loop through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # If the first element is already in the count dictionary, increment its count
        if tup[0] in count_dict:
            count_dict[tup[0]] += 1
        # Otherwise, add the first element to the count dictionary with a count of 1
        else:
            count_dict[tup[0]] = 1
    
    # Create an empty list to store the common first elements
    common_first_elements = []
    
    # Loop through the keys in the count dictionary
    for key in count_dict:
        # If the count of the key is equal to the length of the input list, append it to the common first elements list
        if count_dict[key] == len(Input):
            common_first_elements.append(key)
    
    # Return the common first elements list
    return common_first_elements

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
