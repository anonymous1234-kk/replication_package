I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the first element of each tuple as key
    # and the list of tuples that have the same first element as value
    result_dict = {}

    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # Get the first element of the tuple
        first_element = tup[0]

        # Check if the first element is already a key in the dictionary
        if first_element in result_dict:
            # If it is, append the current tuple to the list of tuples for the key
            result_dict[first_element].append(tup)
        else:
            # If it's not, create a new key for the first element and set its value to
            # a list containing the current tuple
            result_dict[first_element] = [tup]

    # Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples
    result = list(result_dict.items())

    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
