You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    # Create an empty dictionary to store the first element of each tuple as key and a list of tuples as value
    result_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in Input:
        # Check if the first element of the tuple is already a key in the dictionary
        if tup[0] in result_dict:
            # If the key exists, append the tuple to the existing list of values
            result_dict[tup[0]].append(tup)
        else:
            # If the key doesn't exist, create a new list with the tuple as the first value
            result_dict[tup[0]] = [tup]
    
    # Convert the dictionary to a list of tuples and return the result
    return list(result_dict.items())

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
