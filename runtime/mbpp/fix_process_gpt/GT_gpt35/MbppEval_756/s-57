You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_zero_one(text):
    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an 'a' followed by one or more 'b's. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/re/python-re-exercise-3.php
    '''

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_zero_one('ab') == True
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
