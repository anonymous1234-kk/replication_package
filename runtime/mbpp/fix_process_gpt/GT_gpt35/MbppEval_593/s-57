You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''

    """
    Remove leading zeroes from an IP address.

    Args:
    - ip (str): IP address as a string.

    Returns:
    - str: IP address with leading zeroes removed.
    """
    # Split the IP address into its 4 segments.
    segments = ip.split(".")
    
    # Remove any leading zeroes from each segment.
    for i in range(len(segments)):
        segments[i] = str(int(segments[i]))
    
    # Re-join the segments into a single IP address string.
    result = ".".join(segments)
    
    return result

```

----------------------User Message----------------------
The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert removezero_ip('abs.xyz.lmn.abc') == abs.xyz.lmn.abc
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
