You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''

    """
    Removes leading zeros from an IP address.

    Args:
        ip (str): IP address to be processed.

    Returns:
        str: IP address without leading zeros.
    """
    # split IP address into octets
    octets = ip.split(".")
    # remove leading zeros from each octet
    octets = [str(int(octet)) for octet in octets]
    # join octets back into an IP address
    result = ".".join(octets)
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert removezero_ip('abs.xyz.lmn.abc') == abs.xyz.lmn.abc
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
