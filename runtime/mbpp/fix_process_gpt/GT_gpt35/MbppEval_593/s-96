You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
    # Split the ip address by '.' character to get octets of the ip
    octets = ip.split('.')
    
    # Iterate over each octet and remove the leading zeroes
    for i in range(len(octets)):
        octets[i] = str(int(octets[i]))  # convert to int and then back to str to remove leading zeroes
    
    # Join the octets to get the new ip address
    new_ip = '.'.join(octets)
    
    return new_ip

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert removezero_ip('abs.xyz.lmn.abc') == abs.xyz.lmn.abc
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
