You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
    # split the ip address into its components
    parts = ip.split('.')
    
    # iterate over each component and remove any leading zeroes
    for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        parts[i] = re.sub(r'^0+', '', part)
    
    # re-join the components and return the updated ip address
    return '.'.join(parts)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert removezero_ip('0.0.0.0') == 0...
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert removezero_ip('abs.xyz.lmn.abc') == abs.xyz.lmn.abc
assert removezero_ip('144.256.011.025') == 144.256.11.25
assert removezero_ip('1.0.01.02-5') == 1..1.2-5
assert removezero_ip('192.0.02.18') == 192..2.18
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
