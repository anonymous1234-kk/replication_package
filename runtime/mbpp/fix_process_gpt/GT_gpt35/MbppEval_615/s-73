I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def average_tuple(nums):
    '''
    Write a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def average_tuple(nums):
    '''
    Write a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list.
    '''

    """
    Write a function which takes a tuple of tuples and returns the average value for each tuple as a list.
    """
    result = []
    for tup in nums:
        result.append(sum(tup) / len(tup))
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert average_tuple(((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10))) == [5.0, 6.0]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
