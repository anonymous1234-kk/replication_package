You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''
    # Initialize an empty set to hold the flattened numbers.
    flattened_set = set()

    # Loop through each element in the input list.
    for element in test_list:
        # Check if the element is a list.
        if isinstance(element, list):
            # If it is a list, recursively call the function on it to flatten it.
            flattened_set.update(extract_singly(element))
        else:
            # If it is not a list, add the element to the flattened set.
            flattened_set.add(element)

    # Return the flattened set of numbers.
    return flattened_set

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert extract_singly([[], []]) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
