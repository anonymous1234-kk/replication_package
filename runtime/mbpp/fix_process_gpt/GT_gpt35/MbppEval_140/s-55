I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''

    # Creating an empty set to hold the numbers
    numbers = set()
    
    # Looping through each element of the input list
    for element in test_list:
        # Checking if the element is a list
        if isinstance(element, list):
            # If it's a list, adding each element of the list to the set
            for sub_element in element:
                numbers.add(sub_element)
        else:
            # If it's not a list, adding the element itself to the set
            numbers.add(element)
    
    # Returning the set of numbers
    return numbers

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert extract_singly([[], []]) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
