You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''

    # Initializing an empty set to store the numbers
    result = set()
    
    # Iterating through the input list
    for sublist in test_list:
        # If sublist is a list, then iterate through its elements
        if isinstance(sublist, list):
            for element in sublist:
                result.add(element)
        # If sublist is not a list, then add it to the result set
        else:
            result.add(sublist)
    
    # Returning the final set of numbers
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert extract_singly([[], []]) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
