You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def extract_singly(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to flatten the list of lists into a single set of numbers.
    '''

    # create an empty set to store the extracted elements
    result_set = set()

    # iterate through the nested list
    for sublist in test_list:
        # iterate through the elements of the sublist
        for element in sublist:
            # add the element to the result set
            result_set.add(element)

    # return the set with the extracted elements
    return result_set

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert extract_singly([[], []]) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
