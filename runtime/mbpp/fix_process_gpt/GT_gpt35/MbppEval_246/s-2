You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initializing the value of x
    x = number

    # Setting the error threshold
    error = 0.0001

    # Loop until the difference between x and the square root of number is less than the error threshold
    while (x - number / x) > error:
        x = (x + number / x) / 2

    # Return the approximate square root of number
    return x

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(3) == 1.7320508075688772
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
