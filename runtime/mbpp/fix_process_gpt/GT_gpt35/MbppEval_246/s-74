You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initialize the value of x as the given number
    x = number
    # Initialize the value of y as 1
    y = 1
    # Set the value of e as a small value to check the precision of the result
    e = 0.0000001
    # Loop until the difference between x and y is greater than or equal to e
    while x - y > e:
        # Update x with the average of x and y
        x = (x + y) / 2
        # Update y with the value of number divided by x
        y = number / x
    # Return the value of x as the square root of the number
    return x

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(3) == 1.7320508075688772
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
