You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initializing the value of x as the given number
    x = number
    # Initializing the value of y as 1
    y = 1.0
    # Setting the value of e to a small value to check for convergence
    e = 0.0001

    # Looping until the absolute difference between x and y*y is less than e
    while x - y * y > e:
        # Calculating the average of x and y*y
        # and updating the value of y to this average
        y = (y + x / y) / 2
    # Returning the value of y as the square root of the given number
    return y

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(3) == 1.7320508075688772
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
