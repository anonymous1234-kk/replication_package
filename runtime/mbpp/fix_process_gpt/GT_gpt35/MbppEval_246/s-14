You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initialize the approximate square root to the given number
    x = number
    # Loop until convergence is achieved
    while True:
        # Calculate the new approximation for the square root
        y = (x + number / x) / 2
        # Check if the new approximation is equal to the old approximation
        if abs(y - x) < 0.000001:
            # If the new approximation is equal to the old approximation, return it
            return y
        # Update the old approximation with the new approximation
        x = y

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(5) == 2.23606797749979
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(3) == 1.7320508075688772
assert babylonian_squareroot(10) == 3.162277660168379
assert babylonian_squareroot(2) == 1.414213562373095
assert babylonian_squareroot(37) == 6.08276253029822
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
