You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initialize variables
    x = number
    y = 1.0
    
    # Set precision
    eps = 0.0000001
    
    # Loop until convergence
    while abs(x - y) > eps:
        x = (x + y) / 2
        y = number / x
        
    return x

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(3) == 1.7320508075688772
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initialize variables
    x = number
    y = 1.0
    
    # Set precision
    eps = 0.0000001
    
    # Loop until convergence
    while abs(x - y) > eps:
        x = (x + y) / 2
        y = number / x
        
    return round(x, 16)
```

Please note that I have added the `round` function to round the result to 16 decimal places, as the expected result for the test case `babylonian_squareroot(3)` is `1.7320508075688772`.
