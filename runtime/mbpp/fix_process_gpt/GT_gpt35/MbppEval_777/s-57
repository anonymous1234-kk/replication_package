I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''

    # create an empty dictionary to keep track of element count
    count_dict = {}

    # iterate over the list to count the occurrences of each element
    for elem in arr:
        if elem in count_dict:
            count_dict[elem] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[elem] = 1

    # initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0

    # iterate over the list again to add the non-repeated elements to the sum
    for elem in arr:
        if count_dict[elem] == 1:
            total_sum += elem

    # return the total sum
    return total_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
