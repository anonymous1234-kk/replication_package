You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
 
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the elements and their count.
    count_dict = {}
    # Initialize the sum variable to 0.
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the given array.
    for i in arr:
        # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with the count 1.
        if i not in count_dict:
            count_dict[i] = 1
        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
        else:
            count_dict[i] += 1
    # Loop through the dictionary.
    for key, value in count_dict.items():
        # If the count of the element is 1, add it to the sum.
        if value == 1:
            sum += key
    # Return the sum.
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
