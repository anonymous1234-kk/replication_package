I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

        if element not in element_counts:
            non_repeated.append(element)
            element_counts[element] = 1
        # if element has been seen before, increase its count
        else:
            element_counts[element] += 1
    # iterate through the non-repeated list and add each element to the sum
    sum = 0
    for element in non_repeated:
        if element_counts[element] == 1:
            sum += element
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
