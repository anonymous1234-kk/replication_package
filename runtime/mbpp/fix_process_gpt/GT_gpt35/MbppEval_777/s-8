You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''

    """
    Find the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list.

    Args:
    arr (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of non-repeated elements.
    """

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the count of each element in the list
    count_dict = {}

    # Iterate over the list and update the count of each element
    for elem in arr:
        count_dict[elem] = count_dict.get(elem, 0) + 1

    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of non-repeated elements
    sum_non_repeated = 0

    # Iterate over the dictionary and add the non-repeated elements to the sum
    for elem, count in count_dict.items():
        if count == 1:
            sum_non_repeated += elem

    return sum_non_repeated

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
