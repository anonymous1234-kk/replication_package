You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''

    # Create an empty dictionary to store the count of each element
    count = {}
    
    # Loop through each element in the list
    for elem in arr:
        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if elem in count:
            count[elem] += 1
        # Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1
        else:
            count[elem] = 1
    
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through each element in the dictionary
    for elem in count:
        # If the count of the element is 1, add it to the sum
        if count[elem] == 1:
            sum += elem
    
    # Return the sum
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
