I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
    result = 0  # initialize the result as 0
    for i in arr:  # iterate over each element in the array
        if arr.count(i) == 1:  # check if the count of the element in the array is 1
            result += i  # add the element to the result
    return result  # return the final result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
