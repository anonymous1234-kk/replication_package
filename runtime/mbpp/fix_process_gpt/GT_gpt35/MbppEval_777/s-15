You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
 
    # Create an empty list to store the non-repeated elements.
    non_repeated = []
    
    # Loop through each element in the given list.
    for i in arr:
        # Check if the element is repeated or not.
        if arr.count(i) == 1:
            # If the element is not repeated, append it to the non_repeated list.
            non_repeated.append(i)
    
    # Calculate the sum of non-repeated elements using the sum() function.
    return sum(non_repeated)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
