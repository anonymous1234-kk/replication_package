I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
```

```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
    '''
 
    # create an empty set to store elements that have already been seen
    seen = set()
    
    # create a variable to store the sum of non-repeated elements
    sum_non_repeated = 0
    
    # iterate over each element in the input list
    for elem in arr:
        
        # if the element has not been seen before, add it to the sum
        if elem not in seen:
            sum_non_repeated += elem
            
            # add the element to the set of seen elements
            seen.add(elem)
    
    # return the sum of non-repeated elements
    return sum_non_repeated

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_sum(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'd']) == abcd
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == 15
assert find_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 15
assert find_sum([1, 1, 1, 1]) == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def find_sum(arr): 
    seen = set()
    sum_non_repeated = 0
    for elem in arr:
        if arr.count(elem) == 1:
            sum_non_repeated += elem
        seen.add(elem)
    return sum_non_repeated
```
