You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
```

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return False

    # Keep checking till n becomes 0
    while n > 0:
        # Check if the rightmost bit is set
        if n & 1:
            # If it is, then the number is not a power of 2
            # and hence cannot be represented as a sum of powers of 2
            if n >> 1:
                return False
            else:
                return True
        # If the rightmost bit is not set, then right shift the number
        n = n >> 1

    # If n becomes 0, then the number can be represented as a sum of powers of 2
    return True

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(100) == True
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
