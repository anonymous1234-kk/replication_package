You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
```

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''

    # Initialize the variable power to 1.
    power = 1

    # Keep looping until the power becomes greater than n.
    while power <= n:
        # Initialize the variable sum to 0.
        sum = 0

        # Keep looping until the sum becomes greater than n.
        while sum <= n:
            # Add the power to the sum.
            sum += power

            # If the sum is equal to n, return True.
            if sum == n:
                return True

        # Multiply the power by 2.
        power *= 2

    # If we reach here, it means the number cannot be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2.
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(19) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(100) == True
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(150) == True
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(46) == True
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(90) == True
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
