You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''
    # Create a dictionary to store the aggregate scores for each student
    scores_dict = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for name, score in stdata:
        # Add the score to the student's current aggregate
        scores_dict[name] += score
    
    # Find the maximum aggregate score
    max_score = max(scores_dict.values())
    
    return max_score

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_aggregate([(1, 40), (2, 50), (3, 60), (1, 70), (2, 80), (3, 90)]) == (3, 150)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
