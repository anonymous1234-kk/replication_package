You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''
    # create a dictionary to store the aggregate scores for each student
    student_scores = defaultdict(int)

    # iterate through each tuple in the list
    for tup in stdata:
        # unpack the tuple into student name and score
        name, score = tup

        # add the score to the student's existing aggregate score
        student_scores[name] += score

    # return the maximum aggregate score
    return max(student_scores.values())

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_aggregate([(1, 40), (2, 50), (3, 60), (1, 70), (2, 80), (3, 90)]) == (3, 150)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
