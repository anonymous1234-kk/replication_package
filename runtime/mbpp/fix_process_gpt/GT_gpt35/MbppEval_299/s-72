You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_aggregate(stdata):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples.
    '''
    # Create a defaultdict to store the aggregate of each student
    student_aggregate = defaultdict(int)

    # Loop through each tuple in the stdata list
    for student_data in stdata:
        # Calculate the aggregate of the current student
        aggregate = sum(student_data[1:])

        # Update the aggregate of the current student in the dictionary
        student_aggregate[student_data[0]] = max(student_aggregate[student_data[0]], aggregate)

    # Return the maximum aggregate from the dictionary
    return max(student_aggregate.values())

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_aggregate([(1, 40), (2, 50), (3, 60), (1, 70), (2, 80), (3, 90)]) == (3, 150)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def max_aggregate(stdata):
    student_aggregate = defaultdict(int)
    for student_data in stdata:
        aggregate = sum(student_data[1:])
        student_aggregate[student_data[0]] += aggregate
    max_aggregate = max(student_aggregate.values())
    max_student = max(student_aggregate, key=student_aggregate.get)
    return (max_student, max_aggregate)
```
