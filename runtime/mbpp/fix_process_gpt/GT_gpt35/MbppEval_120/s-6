You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    """
    This function takes a list of tuples and finds the maximum absolute product of numbers in each tuple pair.

    Args:
    list1 (list): A list of tuples containing integers or floats.

    Returns:
    max_product (float): The maximum absolute product of numbers in each tuple pair.
    """

    max_product = float('-inf')  # Initialize max_product with negative infinity.

    for pair in combinations(list1, 2):  # Loop over all the possible pairs of tuples.
        product = abs(pair[0][0]*pair[1][0])  # Calculate the absolute product of the first elements of the two tuples.

        for i in range(1, len(pair)):  # Loop over remaining elements in each tuple.
            for j in range(len(pair[0])):  # Loop over remaining elements in each tuple.
                new_product = abs(pair[0][j]*pair[1][i])  # Calculate the absolute product of each pair of elements.
                if new_product > product:  # If the new product is greater than the previous product.
                    product = new_product  # Update the product with the new product.

        if product > max_product:  # If the product of this pair of tuples is greater than the previous maximum product.
            max_product = product  # Update the maximum product with this product.

    return max_product  # Return the maximum absolute product of numbers in each tuple pair.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product_tuple([(4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 5), (10, 11), (6, 7)]) == 110
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python

    max_product = float('-inf')

    for pair in combinations(list1, 2):
        product = abs(pair[0][0]*pair[1][0])

        for i in range(1, len(pair)):
            for j in range(len(pair[0])):
