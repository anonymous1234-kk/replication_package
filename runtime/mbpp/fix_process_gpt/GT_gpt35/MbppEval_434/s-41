You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_one(text):
    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by one or more b's.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def text_match_one(text):
    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by one or more b's.
    '''

    pattern = r'a+b+'
    return re.findall(pattern, text)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_one('ab') == True
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
