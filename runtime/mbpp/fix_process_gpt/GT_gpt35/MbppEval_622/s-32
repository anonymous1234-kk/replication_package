You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
    '''
```

```python
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
    '''

    # Merge the two arrays and sort them
    arr3 = arr1 + arr2
    arr3.sort()

    # Find the median of the merged array
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # If the merged array has an even number of elements, take the average of the two middle elements
        median = (arr3[n//2] + arr3[n//2 - 1]) / 2
    else:
        # If the merged array has an odd number of elements, take the middle element
        median = arr3[n//2]
    return median

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_median([1, 2, 3, 4, 5],[6, 7, 8, 9, 10],0) == 2.5
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
