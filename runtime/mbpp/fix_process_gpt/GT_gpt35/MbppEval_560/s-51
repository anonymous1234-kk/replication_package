I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''

    """
    Find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.

    Args:
    test_tup1 (tuple): first tuple
    test_tup2 (tuple): second tuple
    
    Returns:
    tuple: tuple containing the sorted union of elements of test_tup1 and test_tup2
    
    """
    
    # Concatenate the two tuples
    concatenated_tuple = test_tup1 + test_tup2
    
    # Use set() to remove duplicates and then sort the result
    sorted_union = tuple(sorted(set(concatenated_tuple)))
    
    return sorted_union

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert union_elements(('a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2),(1, 'd', 'e', 'f')) == ('b', 2, 1, 'c', 'd', 'f', 'a', 'e')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
