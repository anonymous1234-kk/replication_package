I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''

    # Using set() to convert tuples to sets and then using | operator to find union of two sets
    union_set = set(test_tup1) | set(test_tup2)
    # Converting the union_set back to a tuple and sorting it
    sorted_union = tuple(sorted(union_set))
    # Returning the sorted union of the two tuples
    return sorted_union

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert union_elements(('a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2),(1, 'd', 'e', 'f')) == ('b', 2, 1, 'c', 'd', 'f', 'a', 'e')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
