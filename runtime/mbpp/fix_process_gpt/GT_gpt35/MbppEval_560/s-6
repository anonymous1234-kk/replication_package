You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''

    """
    This function takes two tuples as input and finds the union of their elements, then sorts them in ascending order.

    :param test_tup1: First input tuple.
    :param test_tup2: Second input tuple.
    :return: A sorted tuple containing the union of the elements of the two input tuples.
    """
    # Using set to find the union of the two tuples.
    union_set = set(test_tup1).union(set(test_tup2))
    # Converting the set to a sorted tuple and returning it.
    return tuple(sorted(union_set))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert union_elements(('a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2),(1, 'd', 'e', 'f')) == ('b', 2, 1, 'c', 'd', 'f', 'a', 'e')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
