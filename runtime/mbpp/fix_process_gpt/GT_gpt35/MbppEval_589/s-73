You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def perfect_squares(a, b):
    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def perfect_squares(a, b):
    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''
    # Create an empty list to store perfect squares
    squares = []

    # Loop through the range of numbers from a to b
    for i in range(a, b+1):
        # Check if the square root of i is an integer
        if int(i**0.5)**2 == i:
            # Append i to the list of squares
            squares.append(i)

    # Return the list of perfect squares
    return squares

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert perfect_squares(-10,-1) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert perfect_squares(3,4) == [4]
assert perfect_squares(15,20) == [16]
assert perfect_squares(10,1) == []
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def perfect_squares(a, b):
    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''

    # Create an empty list to store perfect squares
    squares = []

    # Loop through the range of numbers from a to b
    for i in range(a, b+1):
        # Check if the number is positive and the square root of i is an integer
        if i > 0 and int(i**0.5)**2 == i:
            # Append i to the list of squares
            squares.append(i)

    # Return the list of perfect squares
    return squares
```
