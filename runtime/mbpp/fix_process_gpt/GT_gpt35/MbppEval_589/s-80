You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def perfect_squares(a, b):
    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def perfect_squares(a, b):
    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find perfect squares between two given numbers.
    '''
    squares = [] # create an empty list to store perfect squares
    for num in range(a, b+1): # loop through the range of given numbers
        if num**0.5 == int(num**0.5): # check if the square root of the number is an integer
            squares.append(num) # if yes, then add the number to the list
    return squares # return the list of perfect squares

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert perfect_squares(-10,-1) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert perfect_squares(3,4) == [4]
assert perfect_squares(15,20) == [16]
assert perfect_squares(10,1) == []
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert perfect_squares(-2,2) == [1]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
