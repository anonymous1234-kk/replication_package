I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def newman_prime(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
    '''
```

```python
def newman_prime(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
    '''

    # Define the first two terms of the Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) sequence
    a, b = 1, 1

    # Define the list to store the NSW prime numbers
    primes = []

    # Iterate through the NSW sequence and check if each term is prime
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Check if the current term is prime
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, int(b ** 0.5) + 1):
            if b % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break

        # If the current term is prime, add it to the list of NSW prime numbers
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(b)

        # Calculate the next term in the NSW sequence
        a, b = b, 2 * b - a + 2

    # Return the nth NSW prime number
    return primes[-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert newman_prime(6) == 99
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
