You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def newman_prime(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def newman_prime(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
    '''
 
    if n == 0:  # first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime
        return 1
    if n == 1:  # second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime
        return 2
    nsw_primes = [1, 2]  # first two Newman-Shanks-Williams primes
    i = 2  # starting index
    while len(nsw_primes) < n+1:  # repeat until we have enough
        i += 1  # increment index
        x = (nsw_primes[i-1] * 2) - nsw_primes[i-2]  # calculate next Newman-Shanks-Williams prime
        nsw_primes.append(x)  # add to list of primes
    return nsw_primes[n]  # return the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert newman_prime(6) == 99
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
