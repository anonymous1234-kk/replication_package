You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether all the bits are unset in the given range or not.
    '''
```

```python
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether all the bits are unset in the given range or not.
    '''

    # create a mask that has all bits set from bit position 0 to r
    mask = (1 << (r+1)) - 1
     
    # create a mask that has all bits set from bit position 0 to l-1
    mask1 = (1 << (l-1)) - 1
     
    # perform bitwise AND between n and both masks
    # if the result is 0, then all bits are unset in the given range
    return (n & mask & mask1) == 0

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(25,1,4) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(25,2,4) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
