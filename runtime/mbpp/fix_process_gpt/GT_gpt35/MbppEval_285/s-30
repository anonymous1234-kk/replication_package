You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_two_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def text_match_two_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.
    '''

    pattern = r'a[ab]{2,3}b'
    return bool(re.search(pattern, text))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_two_three('abb') == True
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert text_match_two_three('bab') == False
assert text_match_two_three('1a2b3b') == False
assert text_match_two_three('aabb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('aabb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('aaabb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('baaaaaaabbb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('aaabbb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('aaaabb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('aabb') == True
assert text_match_two_three('aab') == False
assert text_match_two_three('aab') == False
assert text_match_two_three('abbbbbb') == True
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
