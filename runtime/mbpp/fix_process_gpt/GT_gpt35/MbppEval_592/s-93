You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''

    res = 0
    for i in range(k+1):
        res += (factorial(n)//(factorial(i)*factorial(n-i))) * (factorial(n-i)//(factorial(k-i)*factorial(n-k)))
    return res
```

Note: The `factorial` function is not provided in the question. You need to import it from the `math` module. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from math import factorial

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(10,5) == 252
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''

    res = 0
