You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
 
    # Initialize result 
    res = 0
  
    # One by constructs array to store values at
    # different iterations of outer loop
    c = [0] * (k+1) 
  
    c[0] = 1 # First value in line is 1 
  
    # One by one compute next value in line 
    # using the previous value 
    for i in range(1, n+1): 
  
        # Compute next row of pascal triangle using 
        # the previous row
        j = min(i ,k)
        while (j > 0): 
            c[j] = c[j] + c[j-1] 
            res += c[j]
            j -= 1
  
    return res 

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(10,5) == 252
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
