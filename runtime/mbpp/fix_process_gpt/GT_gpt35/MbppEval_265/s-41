You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def list_split(S, step):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def list_split(S, step):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
    '''

    return [S[i:i+step] for i in range(0, len(S), step)]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert list_split([1, 2, 3, 4],0) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    return [S[i:i+step] for i in range(0, len(S), step)]
