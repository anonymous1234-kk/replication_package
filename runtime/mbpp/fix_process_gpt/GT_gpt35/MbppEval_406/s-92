I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_Parity(x): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_Parity(x): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
    '''
 
    # Using the bitwise AND operator to check if the least significant bit is set.
    # If it is set, the result of the operation will be 1, which is truthy in Python.
    # If it's not set, the result will be 0, which is falsy in Python.
    # So we can use the result of the operation as a boolean value to return whether the parity is odd.
    return bool(x & 1)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_Parity(43) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    '''
 
    return x % 2 != 0
