You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    # Calculate the area of the base
    base_area = b * b

    # Calculate the slant height of the pyramid
    slant_height = ((s/2)**2 + b**2)**0.5

    # Calculate the lateral area of the pyramid
    lateral_area = b * slant_height

    # Calculate the total surface area of the pyramid
    surface_area = base_area + lateral_area

    # Return the surface area
    return surface_area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(-1,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(1,-1) == -1
