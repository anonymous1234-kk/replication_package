You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    # Calculate the lateral surface area
    LSA = 0.5 * b * s
    
    # Calculate the base area
    base_area = b ** 2
    
    # Calculate the total surface area
    TSA = LSA + base_area
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return TSA

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(1,-1) == -1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert surface_Area(-1,0) == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    # Check if the inputs are valid
    if b <= 0 or s <= 0:
        return -1

    # Calculate the lateral surface area

    # Calculate the base area
