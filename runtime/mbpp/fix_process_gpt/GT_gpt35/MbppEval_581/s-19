You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
    l = ((b**2)/2 + s**2)**0.5  # calculate slant height
    area = b**2 + 2*b*l         # calculate surface area
    return area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(-1,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
