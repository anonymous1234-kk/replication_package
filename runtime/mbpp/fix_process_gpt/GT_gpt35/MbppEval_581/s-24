You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    # Finding the slant height of the pyramid
    l = (s ** 2 + (4 * b ** 2)) ** 0.5 / 2
    # Finding the area of the base
    area_base = b ** 2
    # Finding the area of each triangular face
    area_triangular_face = 0.5 * b * l
    # Finding the total surface area of the pyramid
    surface_area = area_base + (4 * area_triangular_face)
    # Return the surface area of the pyramid
    return surface_area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(-1,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
