You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_bidirectional(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to count bidirectional tuple pairs.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_bidirectional(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to count bidirectional tuple pairs.
    '''

    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for tup in test_list:
        
        # Check if the tuple is bidirectional by checking if both elements are present in the list
        if tup[::-1] in test_list:
            count += 1
            
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_bidirectional([(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
