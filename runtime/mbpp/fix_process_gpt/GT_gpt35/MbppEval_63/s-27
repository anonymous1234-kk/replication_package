You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''

    max_diff = 0
    for i in range(len(test_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(test_list)):
            diff = abs(test_list[i] - test_list[j])
            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_difference([(1, 2), (3, 5)]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
