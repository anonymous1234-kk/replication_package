You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Find all words ending with 'ly'
    adverbs = re.findall(r'\b\w*ly\b', text)

    # Check if adverb list is empty
    if not adverbs:
        return None

    # Find the first adverb and its positions in the text
    first_adverb = adverbs[0]
    positions = [(m.start(0), m.end(0)) for m in re.finditer(first_adverb, text)]

    # Return a tuple of the first adverb and its positions
    return (first_adverb, positions)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
