You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    """
    Find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.

    Args:
    text (str): Input string to search for adverbs.

    Returns:
    A tuple containing the first adverb ending with ly and its position(s) in the input string.
    If no such adverb is found, returns None.
    """

    # Define the regular expression pattern to search for adverbs ending with "ly"
    adverb_regex = r'\b\w+ly\b'

    # Search for the adverb using the regex pattern
    match = re.search(adverb_regex, text)

    # If a match is found, return the adverb and its position(s)
    if match:
        adverb = match.group()
        return (adverb, match.start(), match.end())

    # If no match is found, return None
    return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
