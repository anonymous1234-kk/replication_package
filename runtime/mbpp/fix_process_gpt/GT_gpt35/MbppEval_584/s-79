You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()

    # Loop through each word and find adverb ending with ly
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        # Use regular expression to match adverbs ending with ly
        if re.match(r'\w*ly\b', word):
            return (word, i)

    # If no adverb is found, return None
    return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
