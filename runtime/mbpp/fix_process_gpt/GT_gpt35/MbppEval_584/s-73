You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Find all adverbs ending with 'ly'
    adverb_indices = [(m.start(0), m.end(0)-1) for m in re.finditer(r'\b\w+ly\b', text)]
    
    # Get the first adverb and its index
    if adverb_indices:
        first_adverb = text[adverb_indices[0][0]:adverb_indices[0][1]+1]
        first_adverb_index = adverb_indices[0][0]
        return (first_adverb, first_adverb_index)
    else:
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
