You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    # Split the text into a list of words
    words = text.split()

    # Find the index of the first adverb ending with 'ly'
    index = None
    for i in range(len(words)):
        if re.search('\w+ly$', words[i]):
            index = i
            break

    # Return the index of the adverb and its position in the text
    if index is not None:
        return (index, text.find(words[index]))
    else:
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
