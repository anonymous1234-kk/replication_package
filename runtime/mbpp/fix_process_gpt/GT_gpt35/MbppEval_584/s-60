You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    # Use regex to find all adverbs ending with ly
    adverbs = re.findall(r'\b\w+ly\b', text)
    
    # If no adverbs found, return None
    if not adverbs:
        return None
    
    # Find the first occurrence of adverb in the text
    adverb = adverbs[0]
    
    # Find the start and end position of the adverb in the text
    start = text.find(adverb)
    end = start + len(adverb) - 1
    
    # Return the adverb and its position as a tuple
    return (adverb, (start, end))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
