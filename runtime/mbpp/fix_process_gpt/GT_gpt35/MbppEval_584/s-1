You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Define a regular expression pattern to match adverbs ending with 'ly'
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b'

    # Search for the pattern in the text
    match = re.search(pattern, text)

    # If a match is found, get the matched text and its positions
    if match:
        adverb = match.group()
        start_pos = match.start()
        end_pos = match.end()
        return f"First adverb ending with 'ly': {adverb}, Positions: {start_pos} - {end_pos}"
    else:
        return 'No adverb found ending with "ly" in the given string.'

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('The position is well-paid and has good benefits.') == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
assert find_adverbs('The early bird catches the worm.') == 4-9: early
assert find_adverbs('I will unashamedly admit that I loved the film.') == 7-18: unashamedly
