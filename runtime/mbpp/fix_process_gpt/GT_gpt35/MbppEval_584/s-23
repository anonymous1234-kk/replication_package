You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b' # Regular expression pattern to match adverbs ending with 'ly'
    match = re.search(pattern, text) # Find the first match
    if match:
        adverb = match.group() # Get the matched adverb
        positions = (match.start(), match.end()) # Get the start and end positions of the matched adverb
        return adverb, positions # Return the matched adverb and its positions as a tuple
    else:
        return None # Return None if no adverb is found

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
