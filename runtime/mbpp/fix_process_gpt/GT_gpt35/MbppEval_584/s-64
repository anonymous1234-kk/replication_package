You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    """
    Finds the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.

    Args:
    text -- a string in which to search for adverbs

    Returns:
    A tuple containing the first adverb ending with ly and its start and end positions if found. Returns None if no adverb is found.
    """
    # Define the regular expression pattern to match adverbs ending with ly
    pattern = r"\b\w+ly\b"

    # Find the first match in the text
    match = re.search(pattern, text)

    # If a match is found, return the match and its start and end positions
    if match:
        return match.group(0), match.start(), match.end()
    else:
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == 20-27: happily
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
