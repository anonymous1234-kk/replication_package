You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # Create a mask with all even bits set to 1
    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA

    # Apply the mask to the input number to set all even bits
    result = n | mask

    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    # Create a mask with all even bits set to 1
    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA

    # Apply the mask to the input number to set all even bits
    result = n | mask

    # Check if the original number and the result are the same
    # If they are not the same, it means that the input number had some odd bits set
    # In this case, we need to unset those odd bits in the result
    if n != result:
        result = result & (~mask)

    return result
```
