You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
    # calculating the binary representation of the number
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # padding with leading zeroes if necessary
    binary = '0'*(len(binary)%2) + binary
    
    # creating a new string with all even bits set to 1
    new_binary = ''.join([binary[i] if i%2 else '1' for i in range(len(binary))])
    
    # converting the new binary string back to an integer and returning it
    return int(new_binary, 2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
