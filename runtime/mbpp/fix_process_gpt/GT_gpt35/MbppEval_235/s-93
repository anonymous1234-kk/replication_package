You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # convert the given number to binary string representation
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # if the length of binary string is odd, we need to add a leading zero
    if len(binary) % 2 != 0:
        binary = '0' + binary
    
    # iterate over every alternate bit starting from the second bit (even bits)
    for i in range(1, len(binary), 2):
        # set the even bit to 1
        binary = binary[:i] + '1' + binary[i+1:]
        
    # convert the modified binary string back to decimal
    return int(binary, 2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(16) == 26
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 7
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
