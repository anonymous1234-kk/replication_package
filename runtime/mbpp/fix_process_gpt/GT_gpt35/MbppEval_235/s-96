You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # get the binary representation of the given number and convert it into a list of bits
    bits = list(bin(n)[2:])
    
    # calculate the length of bits
    l = len(bits)
    
    # if the length of bits is odd, append a '0' bit to the front of bits
    if l % 2 == 1:
        bits.insert(0, '0')
        l += 1
    
    # set all even bits to 1
    for i in range(0, l, 2):
        bits[i] = '1'
    
    # convert the list of bits back to an integer
    result = int(''.join(bits), 2)
    
    # return the result
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
