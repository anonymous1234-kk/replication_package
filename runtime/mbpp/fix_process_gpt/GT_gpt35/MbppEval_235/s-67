You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
 
    # binary representation of the given number
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # length of binary representation
    length = len(binary)
    
    # adding '0' to the beginning of binary representation
    # to make sure it has even length
    if length%2 != 0:
        binary = '0'+binary
        
    # list to store the bits
    bits = list(binary)
    
    # setting even bits to 1
    for i in range(0,length,2):
        bits[i] = '1'
        
    # joining the bits to get the new binary representation
    binary = ''.join(bits)
    
    # converting binary to decimal
    return int(binary,2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
