You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
 
    # Shifting 0xAAAAAAAA (10101010101010101010101010101010 in binary)
    # to the left by 1 bit results in 0x55555555 (01010101010101010101010101010101 in binary).
    # Performing bitwise AND of n and 0x55555555 will set all even bits of n to 1.
    return (n & 0xAAAAAAAA) >> 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    return (n & 0xAAAAAAAA) | ((n & 0x55555555) << 1)
```
