You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    n1, n2 = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    
    # If length of array1 is greater than or equal to the kth element,
    # then return the kth element from array2
    if k <= n1:
        return arr1[k-1]
    
    # If length of array2 is greater than or equal to the kth element,
    # then return the kth element from array2
    elif k <= n2:
        return arr2[k-1]
    
    # If kth element is greater than the sum of lengths of two arrays,
    # then it is not possible to find the kth element in the merged array
    elif k > n1 + n2:
        return -1
    
    # Now, we need to merge two arrays such that the merged array is sorted
    # and then find the kth element in it
    else:
        # Merge two arrays
        merged_array = sorted(arr1 + arr2)
        
        # Return the kth element from merged array
        return merged_array[k-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],0) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
