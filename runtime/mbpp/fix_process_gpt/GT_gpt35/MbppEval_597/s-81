You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    """
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.

    # Get the length of the input arrays

    # Initialize the result variable
    result = None
    
    # Loop until kth smallest element is found
    while k > 0:
        # If one of the arrays is exhausted
        if i == n1:

            break
        
        # Find the minimum element between the two arrays
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            result = arr1[i]
            i += 1

    # Return the kth smallest element
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],0) == 8
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
