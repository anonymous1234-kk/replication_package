You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def long_words(n, str):
    '''
    Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words.
    '''
```

```python
def long_words(n, str):
    '''
    Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find words that are longer than n characters from a given list of words.
    '''
    # Creating an empty list to store words longer than n characters
    word_list = []

    # Loop through each word in the given list
    for word in str:
        # Check if the length of the word is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # If it is, add the word to the word list
            word_list.append(word)

    # Return the word list containing words longer than n characters
    return word_list

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert long_words(2,'The world is a canvas to our imagination') == ['The', 'world', 'canvas', 'our', 'imagination']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert long_words(5,'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog') == []
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    for word in str.split():
        if len(word) > n:
            word_list.append(word)
    return word_list
