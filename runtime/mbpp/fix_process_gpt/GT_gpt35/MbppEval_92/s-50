You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_undulating(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
    '''
```

```python
def is_undulating(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
    '''
    # convert the number to a string and check if its length is greater than or equal to 3
    if len(str(n)) < 3:
        return False
    
    # initialize variables to keep track of the previous difference and whether the previous difference was positive or negative
    prev_diff = None
    prev_diff_positive = None
    
    # iterate through the digits of the number starting at the second digit
    for i in range(1, len(str(n))):
        # calculate the difference between the current and previous digits
        diff = int(str(n)[i]) - int(str(n)[i-1])
        
        # if this is the first digit pair, record the difference and continue to the next pair
        if prev_diff is None:
            prev_diff = diff
            prev_diff_positive = diff > 0
            continue
        
        # if the current difference is the same as the previous difference, return False
        if diff == prev_diff:
            return False
        
        # if the signs of the two differences are the same, return False
        if (diff > 0 and prev_diff_positive) or (diff < 0 and not prev_diff_positive):
            return False
        
        # record the current difference and whether it is positive or negative
        prev_diff = diff
        prev_diff_positive = diff > 0
    
    # if we made it through the loop without returning False, the number is undulating
    return True

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_undulating(121213) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_undulating(4554) == False
assert is_undulating(7887) == False
assert is_undulating(1221) == False
assert is_undulating(123456789) == False
assert is_undulating(121234) == False
assert is_undulating(1234567890987654321) == False
assert is_undulating(76557567) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
