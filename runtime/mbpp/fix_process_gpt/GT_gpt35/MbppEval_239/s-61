You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m,n): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.
    '''
```

    '''
 
    if n == 0: 
        # If n is 0, there is only one possible sequence - an empty sequence.
        return 1
    elif n == 1: 
        # If n is 1, there are m possible sequences - each number from 1 to m.
        return m
    else: 
        # For n greater than 1, we count the total number of sequences by recursively computing the number of valid sequences that end with each possible value for the last element.
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, m+1): 
            if i >= 2*get_total_number_of_sequences(i-1, n-1):
                # If the current value i is greater than or equal to twice the last value in a valid sequence of length n-1, then a valid sequence of length n can end with i.
                count += get_total_number_of_sequences(i-1, n-1)
        return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_total_number_of_sequences(4,4) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
