I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.

    # Initialize a dictionary with default value as 0
    count_dict = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Initialize the count of substrings as 0

    sum_digits = 0
    
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for c in s:

        digit = int(c)
        
        # Add the digit to the sum of digits
        sum_digits += digit
        
        # Check if the sum of digits is equal to the length of the substring
        if sum_digits == count_dict[sum_digits]:
            # Increment the count of substrings
            count += 1
        
        # Increment the count of substrings with the same sum of digits
        count_dict[sum_digits] += 1
        
    # Return the count of substrings
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
