I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

        # Calculate the difference between the current sum and the current index
        diff = curr_sum - (i + 1)
        
        # If the difference is 0 and the current sum is greater than 0, increment the valid count
        if diff == 0 and curr_sum > 0:

    return valid_count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('abcd') == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
assert count_Substrings('10') == 1
assert count_Substrings('1234') == 1
assert count_Substrings('123456') == 1
assert count_Substrings('12345678') == 1
assert count_Substrings('123456789') == 1
assert count_Substrings('1993') == 1
assert count_Substrings('9824') == 0
assert count_Substrings('41352') == 1
assert count_Substrings('121') == 2
assert count_Substrings('123') == 1
assert count_Substrings('1221') == 2
assert count_Substrings('1') == 1
assert count_Substrings('11') == 3
assert count_Substrings('12') == 1
assert count_Substrings('0') == 0
assert count_Substrings('1234') == 1
assert count_Substrings('165') == 1
assert count_Substrings('116518') == 4
assert count_Substrings('99') == 0
assert count_Substrings('123000123') == 10
assert count_Substrings('3410391') == 2
assert count_Substrings('10101') == 3
assert count_Substrings('1234') == 1
assert count_Substrings('123456789') == 1
assert count_Substrings('9') == 0
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
