I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each sum.
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    # Initialize the count of valid substrings to zero.
    count = 0
    # Iterate over all possible substrings of s.
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            # Calculate the sum of digits in the current substring.
            substr_sum = sum(int(d) for d in s[i:j])
            # If the sum is equal to the length of the substring, increment the count and update the frequency dictionary.
            if substr_sum == j - i:
                count += 1
                freq[substr_sum] += 1
    # Return the count and the frequency dictionary.
    return count, freq

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
