I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count of substrings with a given sum
    count_dict = defaultdict(int)

    # Initialize variables to store the sum of digits and the count of substrings
    curr_sum = 0
    curr_count = 0

    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Convert the character to an integer
        num = int(char)

        # Add the integer to the current sum
        curr_sum += num

        # Check if the current sum is equal to the current count
        if curr_sum == curr_count:
            # If it is, increment the count of substrings with this sum
            count_dict[curr_sum] += 1

        # Increment the count of substrings by the count of substrings with the current sum
        curr_count += count_dict[curr_sum]

    # Return the total count of substrings
    return sum(count_dict.values())

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
