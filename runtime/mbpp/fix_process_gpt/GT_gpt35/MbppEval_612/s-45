I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def merge(lst):  
    '''
    Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second.
    '''
```

```python
def merge(lst):  
    '''
    Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second.
    '''
  
    # Create two empty lists
    list1 = []
    list2 = []
    
    # Iterate over the input list and append the first and second elements of each sublist to list1 and list2 respectively
    for sub_list in lst:
        list1.append(sub_list[0])
        list2.append(sub_list[1])
    
    # Return a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second
    return [list1, list2]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert merge([[], []]) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def merge(lst):
    list1 = []
    list2 = []

    for sub_list in lst:
        if len(sub_list) > 0:
            list1.append(sub_list[0])
        if len(sub_list) > 1:
            list2.append(sub_list[1])

    return [list1, list2]
```
