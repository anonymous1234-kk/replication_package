I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def merge(lst):  
    '''
    Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second.
    '''
```

    '''
  
    first_list = [sub[0] for sub in lst] # Get the first element of each sublist
    second_list = [sub[1] for sub in lst] # Get the second element of each sublist
    return [first_list, second_list] # Return a list of two lists

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert merge([[], []]) == []
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def merge(lst):
    first_list = [sub[0] for sub in lst if sub]  # Get the first element of each sublist if sublist is not empty
    second_list = [sub[1] for sub in lst if sub]  # Get the second element of each sublist if sublist is not empty
    return [first_list, second_list] if first_list or second_list else []  # Return a list of two lists if either of them is not empty, else return an empty list
