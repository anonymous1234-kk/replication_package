You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''

    # Create a list to store the sequence
    seq = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Base cases
    seq[1] = 1
    seq[2] = 1

    # Calculate sequence for n>2
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        seq[i] = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[i - seq[i - 1]]

    # Return the nth number in the sequence
    return seq[n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sequence(1) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert sequence(8) == 4
assert sequence(9) == 5
assert sequence(10) == 6
assert sequence(3) == 2
assert sequence(6) == 4
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
