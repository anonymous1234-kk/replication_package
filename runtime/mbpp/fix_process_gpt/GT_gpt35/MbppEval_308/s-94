You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''
```

```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''

    heap = []
    for n1 in nums1:
        for n2 in nums2:
            product = n1 * n2
            if len(heap) < N:
                heapq.heappush(heap, product)
            elif heap[0] < product:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, product)
    return heap

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert large_product([1, 3, -5, 7, 8],[2, 4, 6, -9],3) == [48, 45, 42]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
import heapq

def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''

    heap = []
    for n1 in nums1:
        for n2 in nums2:
            product = n1 * n2
            if len(heap) < N:
                heapq.heappush(heap, product)
            elif heap[0] < product:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, product)
    return sorted(heap, reverse=True)
```
