You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''

    products = [a * b for a, b in product(nums1, nums2)]
    largest_products = sorted(products, reverse=True)[:N]
    return largest_products

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert large_product([1, 3, -5, 7, 8],[2, 4, 6, -9],3) == [48, 45, 42]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
from itertools import product

def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''

    products = [a * b for a, b in product(nums1, nums2)]
    largest_products = sorted(products, reverse=True)[:N]
    return largest_products
```
