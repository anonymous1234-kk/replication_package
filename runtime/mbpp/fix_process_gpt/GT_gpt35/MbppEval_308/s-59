You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''

    """
    Finds the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    :param nums1: List of integers.
    :param nums2: List of integers.
    :param N: Number of products to find.
    :return: List of N largest products.
    """
    # Generate all possible pairs of numbers, one from each list
    pairs = product(nums1, nums2)
    
    # Calculate the product of each pair
    products = [a * b for a, b in pairs]
    
    # Return the N largest products
    return sorted(products, reverse=True)[:N]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert large_product([1, 3, -5, 7, 8],[2, 4, 6, -9],3) == [48, 45, 42]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
