I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import cmath
def angle_complex(a,b):
    '''
    Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import cmath
def angle_complex(a,b):
    '''
    Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
    '''
    # create a complex number using the real and imaginary parts
    c = complex(a, b)
    # use cmath.phase to get the angle of the complex number
    angle = cmath.phase(c)
    return angle

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert angle_complex(2,4) == 0.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
