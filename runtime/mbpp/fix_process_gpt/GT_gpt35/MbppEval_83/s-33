You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_Char(strr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
    '''
```

```python
def get_Char(strr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
    '''

    # Initialize a variable `sum_ascii` to store the sum of ASCII values of all characters in the given string
    sum_ascii = 0
    
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in strr:
        # Get the ASCII value of the character and add it to the sum
        sum_ascii += ord(char)
    
    # Take modulo 26 of the sum of ASCII values and add 65 to get the corresponding character in uppercase
    # Here, 65 is the ASCII value of 'A'
    result_ascii = (sum_ascii % 26) + 65
    
    # Convert the ASCII value to character and return it
    return chr(result_ascii)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_Char('abc') == f
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
