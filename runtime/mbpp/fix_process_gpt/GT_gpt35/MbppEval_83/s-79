I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_Char(strr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
    '''
```

```python
def get_Char(strr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
    '''
  
    total = 0
  
    # Loop through each character of the string
    for char in strr:
        # Add the ASCII value of each character to total
        total += ord(char)
  
    # Take modulo 26 of total and add 65 (ASCII value of 'A') to get the corresponding character
    result = chr((total % 26) + 65)
  
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_Char('abc') == f
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
