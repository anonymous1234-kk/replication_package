I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_Char(strr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def get_Char(strr):  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the character made by adding the ASCII value of all the characters of the given string modulo 26.
    '''

    # initializing sum to zero
    sum_of_ascii = 0

    # iterating over each character of the string
    for char in strr:
        # adding ASCII value of each character to the sum
        sum_of_ascii += ord(char)

    # taking modulo 26 of the sum to get the final result
    result = sum_of_ascii % 26

    # returning the character corresponding to the final result
    return chr(result + 65)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_Char('abc') == f
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
