You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_solution(a, b, n):
    '''
    Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_solution(a, b, n):
    '''
    Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists.
    '''

    for x in range(-n, n+1):
        for y in range(-n, n+1):
            if a*x + b*y == n:
                return (x,y)
    return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_solution(2,3,12) == (0, 4)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
