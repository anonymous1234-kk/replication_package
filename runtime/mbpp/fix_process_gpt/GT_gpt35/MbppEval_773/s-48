You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''

    """
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    """
    # Check if pattern is found in text
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    if match:
        # If pattern is found, get the position and occurrence of the pattern
        start_position = match.start()
        end_position = match.end()
        occurrence = text.count(pattern)
        
        # Return a tuple of the position and occurrence
        return (start_position, end_position, occurrence)
    else:
        # If pattern is not found, return None
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert occurance_substring('Hello, World','o') == ('o', 4, 5)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
