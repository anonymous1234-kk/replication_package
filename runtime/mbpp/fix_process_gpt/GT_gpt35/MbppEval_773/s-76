You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''
    # Find all matches of the pattern within the text
    matches = re.finditer(pattern, text)
    
    # If there are no matches, return None
    if not matches:
        return None
    
    # Otherwise, create a list of tuples containing the start and end positions of each match
    positions = [(match.start(), match.end()) for match in matches]
    
    # Return the list of positions
    return positions

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert occurance_substring('Hello, World','o') == ('o', 4, 5)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
