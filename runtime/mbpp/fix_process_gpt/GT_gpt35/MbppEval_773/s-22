You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text,pattern):
    '''
    Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
    '''

    # Find all occurrences of the pattern within the text
    matches = re.finditer(pattern, text)
    if not matches:
        return None
    else:
        # Create a list to store the matches
        match_list = []
        # Loop through the matches and store the start and end positions
        for match in matches:
            start_pos = match.start()
            end_pos = match.end()
            # Append the match and its positions to the list
            match_list.append((match.group(), start_pos, end_pos))
        return match_list

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert occurance_substring('Hello, World','o') == ('o', 4, 5)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
