You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize lis[] and lds[] with 1
    lis = [1 for i in range(n)]
    lds = [1 for i in range(n)]

    # Compute LIS values from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and lis[i] < lis[j] + 1:
                lis[i] = lis[j] + 1

    # Compute LDS values from right to left
    for i in reversed(range(n-1)):
        for j in reversed(range(i-1, n)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and lds[i] < lds[j] + 1:
                lds[i] = lds[j] + 1

    # Find the maximum value of lis[i] + lds[i] - 1
    maximum = lis[0] + lds[0] - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        maximum = max(maximum, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1)

    return maximum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
