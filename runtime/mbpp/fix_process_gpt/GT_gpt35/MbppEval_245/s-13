I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

    '''

    '''
 
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Initialize LIS and LDS arrays with 1
    lis = [1]*n 
    lds = [1]*n
  
    # Compute LIS values from left to right
    for i in range (1, n): 
        for j in range(0, i): 
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and lis[i]< lis[j] + 1: 
                lis[i] = lis[j]+1
  
    # Compute LDS values from right to left
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1): 
        for j in range(n-1, i, -1): 
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and lds[i] < lds[j] + 1: 
                lds[i] = lds[j] + 1
  
    # Find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence
    max_sum = lis[0] + lds[0] - 1
    for i in range(1,n): 
        max_sum = max(max_sum, lis[i] + lds[i]-1) 
          
    return max_sum

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
