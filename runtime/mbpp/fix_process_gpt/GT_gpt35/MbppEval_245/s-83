I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

    '''
 
    n = len(arr) 
  
    # Initialize dp arrays with 0s
    inc_dp = [0] * n 
    dec_dp = [0] * n 
  
    # Initialize the first element of the arrays with the first element of arr
    inc_dp[0] = arr[0] 
    dec_dp[0] = arr[n-1] 
  
    # Compute the increasing subsequence sum from left to right
    for i in range(1, n): 
        for j in range(i): 
            if arr[i] > arr[j]: 
                inc_dp[i] = max(inc_dp[i], inc_dp[j]) 
        inc_dp[i] += arr[i] 
  
    # Compute the decreasing subsequence sum from right to left
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1): 
        for j in range(n-1, i, -1): 
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:

    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(n): 
        max_sum = max(max_sum, inc_dp[i] + dec_dp[i] - arr[i]) 
  
    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
