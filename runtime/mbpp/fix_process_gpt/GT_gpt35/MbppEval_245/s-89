You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    lis = [0]*n
    lds = [0]*n
    lis[0] = arr[0]
    lds[-1] = arr[-1]

    for i in range(1, n):
        lis[i] = max(arr[i], lis[i-1])

    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        lds[i] = max(arr[i], lds[i+1])

    max_sum = -float("inf")
    for i in range(n):
        max_sum = max(max_sum, lis[i] + lds[i] - arr[i])

    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
