You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
 
    n = len(arr) 
  
    # Initialize dp arrays for increasing and decreasing sequences
    inc = [0 for i in range(n)] 
    dec = [0 for i in range(n)] 
  
    # Initialize the first element of both dp arrays
    inc[0] = arr[0] 
    dec[n-1] = arr[n-1] 
  
    # Compute the increasing sequence dp array
    for i in range(1, n): 
        if arr[i] > arr[i-1]: 
            inc[i] = inc[i-1] + arr[i] 
        else: 
            inc[i] = arr[i] 

    # Compute the decreasing sequence dp array
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1): 
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]: 
            dec[i] = dec[i+1] + arr[i] 
        else: 
            dec[i] = arr[i] 

    # Find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(n): 
        curr_sum = inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i] 
        if curr_sum > max_sum: 
            max_sum = curr_sum 

    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
