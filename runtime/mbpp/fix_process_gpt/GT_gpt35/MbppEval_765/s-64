I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/

```

    """
    A function to find nth polite number. A polite number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. 
    This function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth polite number.

    # Check if n is a positive integer
    if n <= 0:

    # The first polite number is 1

    while n > 0:
        # check if polite_num is polite, i.e., it can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers
        for i in range(1, polite_num):
            # calculate the sum of consecutive positive integers from i to j
            j = (2 * polite_num + i - i**2 - 2 * polite_num * i) / (2 * i - 2)
            # check if the sum equals polite_num and all numbers are positive integers
            if j > i and j == int(j):

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(20) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
