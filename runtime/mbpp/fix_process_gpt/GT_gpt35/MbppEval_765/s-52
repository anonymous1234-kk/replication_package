I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
    # calculate the maximum power of 2 less than or equal to n and store it in the variable power
    power = int(math.log2(n)) 
    # initialize the polite number to 0
    polite_num = 0 
    # loop through each power of 2 from power to 0
    for i in range(power, -1, -1): 
        # set the bit at position i in polite_num to 1
        polite_num = polite_num | 1 << i 
        # calculate the difference between the polite number and n
        diff = n - polite_num 
        # if the difference is negative or 0, set the bit at position i in polite_num to 0
        if diff <= 0: 
            polite_num = polite_num & ~(1 << i) 
        # if the difference is a power of 2, return the polite number
        elif math.log2(diff).is_integer(): 
            return polite_num 
    # if we get to this point, there is no nth polite number
    return -1 

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(20) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
