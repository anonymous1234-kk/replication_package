I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
```

    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
 
    """
    Find the nth polite number.
    A number is called polite if it can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
    For example, 9 is a polite number because it can be expressed as 2 + 3 + 4.

        max_length = int((math.sqrt(8*n - 7) - 1)/2)

        for length in range(max_length, 0, -1):

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(20) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
