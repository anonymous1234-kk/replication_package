You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
 
    # Given a positive integer n, the nth polite number is the smallest positive integer that can be written as 
    # the sum of at least n powers of 2, where the powers are allowed to be negative or zero. 
    # For example, the first polite number is 1 because it can be written as 2^0, 
    # the second polite number is 2 because it can be written as 2^1, 
    # the third polite number is 3 because it can be written as 2^0 + 2^-1, 
    # the fourth polite number is 4 because it can be written as 2^2, 
    # the fifth polite number is 5 because it can be written as 2^0 + 2^2, 
    # and so on.
    
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    ans = 0
    for i, b in enumerate(reversed(binary)):
        if b == "1":
            ans += int(math.pow(2, i))
    return ans

```

----------------------User Message----------------------
The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(20) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
