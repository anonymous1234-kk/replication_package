You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
```

    # First polite number is always 1
    if n == 1:

    current_number_of_factors = 2

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(20) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
