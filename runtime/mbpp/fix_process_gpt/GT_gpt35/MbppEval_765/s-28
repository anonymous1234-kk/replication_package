You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
```

    # Initializations 
    politeCount = 0
    i = 1
 
    # Iterate until politeCount is not equal to n
    while (politeCount != n):
 
        # Calculate the ith power of 2
        powerI = int(math.pow(2, i))
 
        # Iterate from 1 to i
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
 
            # Calculate the jth power of 2
            powerJ = int(math.pow(2, j))
 
            # Calculate the difference between powerI and powerJ
            diff = powerI - powerJ
 
            # If diff is divisible by (powerI / 2) or not 
            if (diff % (powerI // 2) == 0):
                politeCount += 1
 
                # If the current number is nth polite number
                if (politeCount == n):

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(20) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import math

def is_polite(n):
    politeCount = 0
    i = 1

    while politeCount != n:
        powerI = int(math.pow(2, i))

        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            powerJ = int(math.pow(2, j))
            diff = powerI - powerJ

            if diff % (powerI // 2) == 0:
                politeCount += 1

                if politeCount == n:
                    return diff

        i += 1
```
