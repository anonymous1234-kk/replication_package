You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''

    return [(tup[K:],) for tup in test_list]
