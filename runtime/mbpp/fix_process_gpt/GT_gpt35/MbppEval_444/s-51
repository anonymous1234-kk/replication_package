I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.

    # Initialize an empty list to store the trimmed tuples
    result_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the given list
    for tup in test_list:
        # Get the length of the tuple
        n = len(tup)
        
        # If n is less than or equal to K, append the original tuple to the result list
        if n <= K:
