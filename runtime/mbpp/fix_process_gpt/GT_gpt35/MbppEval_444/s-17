I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''

    # Create an empty list to store the trimmed tuples
    trimmed_list = []
  
    # Loop through each tuple in the test_list
    for tup in test_list:
        # Create a new tuple by removing the first K elements from the original tuple
        trimmed_tup = tup[K:]
        # Append the new tuple to the trimmed_list
        trimmed_list.append(trimmed_tup)
  
    # Return the trimmed_list
