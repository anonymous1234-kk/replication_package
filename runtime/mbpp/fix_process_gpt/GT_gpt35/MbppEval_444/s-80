I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''

    # Loop through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(test_list)):
        # Slice the tuple from the beginning to Kth element
        test_list[i] = test_list[i][:K]
    # Return the modified list
    return test_list
