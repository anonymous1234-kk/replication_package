You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def volume_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def volume_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume.
    '''

    pi = 3.14  # Define the value of pi
    volume = pi * r**2 * h  # Calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula
    return volume  # Return the calculated volume

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert volume_cylinder(-1,-1) == -3.1415
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert volume_cylinder(3,6) == 169.641
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert volume_cylinder(-1,-1) == -3.1415
assert volume_cylinder(2,5) == 62.830000000000005
assert volume_cylinder(-1,5) == 15.707500000000001
assert volume_cylinder(2,-1) == -12.566
assert volume_cylinder(1,0) == 0.0
assert volume_cylinder(1,10) == 31.415000000000003
```
