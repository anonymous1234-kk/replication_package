You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    # Define a list of adverbs to look for
    adverbs = ['quickly', 'slowly', 'loudly', 'quietly', 'easily', 'difficultly', 'happily', 'sadly', 'angrily', 'calmly']

    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()

    # Loop through the words and find the first adverb
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        # Strip any punctuation from the word
        word = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', word)
        # Check if the word is an adverb
        if word in adverbs:
            # Return the position of the adverb
            return i+1  # Position starts from 1, not 0
    # If no adverb is found, return -1
    return -1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == ('early', 5)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
