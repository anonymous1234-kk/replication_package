I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    words = text.split()  # Split the text into words
    for i in range(len(words)):
        word = words[i]
        if re.search(r'\b\w+ly\b', word):  # Check if the word is an adverb
            return i+1, word  # Return the position of the adverb and the adverb itself
    return -1, None  # If no adverb is found, return -1 and None

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == ('early', 5)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
