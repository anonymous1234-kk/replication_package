You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    # Define a list of adverbs to check against
    adverbs = ['quickly', 'slowly', 'quietly', 'loudly', 'softly', 'happily', 'sadly', 'angrily']
    
    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()
    
    # Loop through the words and check if each one is an adverb
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        if re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(word), ' '.join(adverbs), re.IGNORECASE):
            # The word is an adverb, so return its position
            return i + 1  # add 1 to convert from zero-indexed to one-indexed
    
    # No adverb was found
    return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('I am early in the morning at the office') == ('early', 5)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
