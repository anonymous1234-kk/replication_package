You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    # define a regular expression to match adverbs
    adverb_pattern = r"\b\w+ly\b"

    # find the first adverb in the text
    match = re.search(adverb_pattern, text)

    # if an adverb is found, return its position
    if match:
        start, end = match.span()
        return f"The first adverb '{match.group()}' starts at position {start} and ends at position {end-1}."
    
    # if no adverb is found, return a message
    return "No adverb found in the text."

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('She sang sweetly') == ('sweetly', 9)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    # define a regular expression to match adverbs
    adverb_pattern = r"\b\w+ly\b"

    # find the first adverb in the text
    match = re.search(adverb_pattern, text)

    # if an adverb is found, return its position
    if match:
        start, end = match.span()
        return match.group(), start

    # if no adverb is found, return None
    return None

assert find_adverb_position('She sang sweetly') == ('sweetly', 9)
```
