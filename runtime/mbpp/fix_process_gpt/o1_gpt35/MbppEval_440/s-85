I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverb_position(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb and their positions in a given sentence.
    '''
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b' # Define pattern for adverbs ending in "ly"
    match = re.search(pattern, text) # Search for the first match of the pattern in the text
    if match: # If a match is found
        return match.start(), match.end() # Return the start and end positions of the match
    else: # If no match is found
        return None # Return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverb_position('She sang sweetly') == ('sweetly', 9)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
