Here is the question.
```python
def volume_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def volume_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the the volume.
