You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from math import tan, pi
def area_polygon(s, l):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.
    '''
```
