You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from math import tan, pi
def area_polygon(s, l):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
from math import tan, pi
def area_polygon(s, l):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.
    '''

    """
    Calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.

    Parameters:
    s (int or float): Length of each side of the polygon
    l (int): Number of sides of the polygon

    Returns:
    float: Area of the polygon
    """
    perimeter = s * l
    apothem = s / (2 * tan(pi / l))
    area = 0.5 * perimeter * apothem
    return area
```

Note: The formula used to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length of its side (`s`) and the number of sides (`l`) is:

```
area = 0.5 * s * l * (s / (2 * tan(pi / l)))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert area_polygon(8,7) == 236.3961030678927
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
