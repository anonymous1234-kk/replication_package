You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from math import tan, pi
def area_polygon(s, l):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.
    '''
```

```python
from math import tan, pi
def area_polygon(s, l):
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the area of a regular polygon given the length and number of its sides.
    '''
    perimeter = s * l
    apothem = s / (2 * tan(pi / l))
    area = 0.5 * perimeter * apothem
    return area
```

This function takes two arguments `s` and `l`, representing the length of a side and the number of sides in the polygon respectively. It uses the formula for the area of a regular polygon, which is:

```
area = (1/2) * perimeter * apothem
```

where `perimeter` is the total distance around the polygon (i.e. the perimeter), and `apothem` is the distance from the center of the polygon to the midpoint of a side.

The function first calculates the perimeter of the polygon by multiplying the length of a side `s` by the number of sides `l`. It then calculates the apothem using the formula:

```
apothem = s / (2 * tan(pi / l))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert area_polygon(8,7) == 236.3961030678927
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
