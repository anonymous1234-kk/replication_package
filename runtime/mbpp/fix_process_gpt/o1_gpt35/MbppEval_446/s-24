I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
 
    # Count the occurence of each element in the tuple
    count = Counter(tup) 
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count of each element in the list
    dict = {} 
    # Iterate over the list
    for item in lst:
        # If the element is present in the tuple, add it to the dictionary with its count
        if item in count:
            dict[item] = count[item]
        # If the element is not present in the tuple, add it to the dictionary with count 0
        else:
            dict[item] = 0
    # Return the dictionary
    return dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9),[1, 1, 3, 3]) == [3, 3, 1, 1]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == {'a': 4, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9),[1, 3, 10]) == {1: 3, 3: 1, 10: 0}
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7),[8, 9]) == {8: 0, 9: 0}
assert count_Occurrence((),[1, 2, 3]) == {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0}
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7),[9]) == {9: 0}
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7),[0]) == {0: 0}
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['f']) == {'f': 0}
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9),[1, 3]) == {1: 3, 3: 1}
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
