You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9),[1, 3, 10]) == {1: 3, 3: 1, 10: 0}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == {'a': 4, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
