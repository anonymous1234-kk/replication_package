I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import Counter 
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
    '''
    # create a dictionary with count of each element in lst
    count_dict = Counter(lst)
    
    # create a dictionary to store count of elements in tup
    result_dict = dict.fromkeys(tup, 0)
    
    # iterate over the elements of tup and update result_dict with the count of each element
    for element in tup:
        if element in count_dict:
            result_dict[element] = count_dict[element]
    
    # return the result_dict
    return result_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'a', 'd', 'd', 'c', 'c', 'e', 'e', 'd', 'a'),['a', 'c', 'd']) == {'a': 4, 'c': 3, 'd': 5}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
