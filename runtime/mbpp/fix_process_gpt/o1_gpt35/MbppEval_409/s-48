I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    min_product = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(list1)):
            product = list1[i][0] * list1[j][0] + list1[i][1] * list1[j][1]
            if product < min_product:
                min_product = product
    return min_product

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_product_tuple([(2, 3), (5, 2), (3, 6), (1, 2)]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
