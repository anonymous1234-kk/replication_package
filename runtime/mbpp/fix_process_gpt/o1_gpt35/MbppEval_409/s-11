I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    # sort the list of tuples
    list1.sort()

    # multiply first two tuples having smallest values
    min_product = list1[0][0] * list1[1][0]

    # iterate through the list and find the minimum product
    for i in range(len(list1)):

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_product_tuple([(4, 5), (5, 7), (9, 8), (2, 3), (3, 5), (-4, 5)]) == -20
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
