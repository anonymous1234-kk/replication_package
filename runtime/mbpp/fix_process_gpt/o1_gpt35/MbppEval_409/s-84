I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def min_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
