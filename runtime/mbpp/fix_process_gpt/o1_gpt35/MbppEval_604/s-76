You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def reverse_words(s):
    '''
    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def reverse_words(s):
    '''
    Write a function to reverse words seperated by spaces in a given string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to reverse words separated by spaces in a given string.
    '''
    words = s.split(' ')
    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
    return ' '.join(reversed_words)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert reverse_words('A visualized representation of data,') == data, of representation visualized A
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
