I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def set_middle_bits(n):  
    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/toggle-bits-number-expect-first-last-bits/
    '''

    # Find the number of bits in the given integer
    num_bits = n.bit_length()

    # Generate a mask that has 1's in the middle bits
    mask = (1 << (num_bits - 2)) - 1

    # Toggle all the middle bits
    result = n ^ mask

    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert set_middle_bits(5) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert set_middle_bits(3) == 3
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
