I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    adverbs = []
    positions = []
    
    # Find all the adverbs ending with "ly" in the given text
    regex = r"\b\w+ly\b"
    matches = re.finditer(regex, text)
    
    # Store the adverbs and their positions in the respective lists
    for match in matches:
        adverbs.append(match.group())
        positions.append(match.start())
    
    # Return the first adverb and its position as a tuple
    if adverbs:
        return (adverbs[0], positions[0])
    else:
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == ('happily', (20, 27))
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
