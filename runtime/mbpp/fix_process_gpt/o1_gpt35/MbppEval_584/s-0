I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()
    
    # Initialize a list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Loop through each word
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        # Check if the word ends with 'ly' and is an adverb
        if re.match(r'^\w+ly$', word):
            # If so, append the word and its position to the result list
            result.append((word, i))
    
    # Return the result list
    return result

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == ('happily', (20, 27))
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
