You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('He spoke briefly about the new project proposal.') == ('briefly', 9, 16)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_adverbs('The position is well-paid and has good benefits.') == None
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
