You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Split the text into words
    words = text.split()
    # Initialize an empty list to store the adverb positions
    adverb_positions = []
    # Loop through each word in the text
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        # Use regex to check if the word is an adverb ending with "ly"
        if re.match(r"\b\w+ly\b", word):
            # Append the position of the adverb to the adverb_positions list
            adverb_positions.append(i)
    # Return the first adverb and its position
    if adverb_positions:
        return words[adverb_positions[0]], adverb_positions[0]
    else:
        return None, None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('The position is well-paid and has good benefits.') == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
