I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    # Define the pattern for adverbs ending with ly
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b'
    
    # Find the first match of the pattern in the given text
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    
    # If no match found, return None
    if not match:
        return None
    
    # Get the position of the match
    start_pos = match.start()
    end_pos = match.end()
    
    # Return a tuple of the matched adverb and its position
    return (match.group(), start_pos, end_pos)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == ('happily', (20, 27))
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
