You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Define the regular expression pattern for finding adverbs ending with "ly"
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b'

    # Use the findall() method of the regular expression module to find all matches of the pattern
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

    # If there are no matches, return None
    if not matches:
        return None

    # Otherwise, return the first match and its start and end positions in the string
    match = matches[0]
    start = text.index(match)
    end = start + len(match)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == ('happily', (20, 27))
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
