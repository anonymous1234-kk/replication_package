You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # Define a pattern to match adverbs ending with "ly"
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b'
    
    # Find the first match in the text
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    
    # If a match is found, return the adverb and its positions
    if match:
        adverb = match.group(0)
        positions = match.span()
        return adverb, positions
    
    # If no match is found, return None
    else:
        return None

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('He spoke briefly about the new project proposal.') == ('briefly', 9, 16)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_adverbs('The position is well-paid and has good benefits.') == None
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
