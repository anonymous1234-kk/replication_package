I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b' # Regular expression pattern to match adverbs ending with 'ly'
    match = re.search(pattern, text) # Find the first match
    if match:
        adverb = match.group() # Get the matched adverb
        positions = (match.start(), match.end()) # Get the start and end positions of the matched adverb
        return adverb, positions # Return the matched adverb and its positions as a tuple
    else:
        return None # Return None if no adverb is found

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('I have been working tirelessly on this project for the last six months.') == ('tirelessly', 22, 32)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_adverbs('The position is well-paid and has good benefits.') == None
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
