You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    # find all the adverbs ending with 'ly' and return their positions
    pattern = r'\b\w+ly\b'
    adverbs = re.findall(pattern, text)
    positions = []
    for adverb in adverbs:
        positions.append(text.find(adverb))
    return positions

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('The position is well-paid and has good benefits.') == None
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
