I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def find_adverbs(text):
    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
```

    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the first adverb ending with ly and its positions in a given string.
    '''
    # Define a regex pattern to match adverbs ending with ly
    pattern = r"\b\w+ly\b"
    
    # Search for the first adverb in the text
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    
    # If an adverb is found, return its value and position
    if match:
        return (match.group(0), match.start(0))
    
    # If no adverb is found, return None
    else:
        return None

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_adverbs('She has been living happily since she moved to New York.') == ('happily', (20, 27))
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
