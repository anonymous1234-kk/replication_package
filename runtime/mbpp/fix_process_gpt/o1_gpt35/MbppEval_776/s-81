You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_vowels(test_str):
    '''
    Write a function to count those characters which have vowels as their neighbors in the given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_vowels(test_str):
    '''
    Write a function to count those characters which have vowels as their neighbors in the given string.
    '''

    # Define a set of vowels to check against
    vowels = set("AEIOUaeiou")
    
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(1, len(test_str)):
        # Check if the current character and the previous character are both vowels
        if test_str[i] in vowels and test_str[i-1] in vowels:
            # If they are, increment the count
            count += 1
            
    # Return the count
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_vowels('I am fine thank you') == 10
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
