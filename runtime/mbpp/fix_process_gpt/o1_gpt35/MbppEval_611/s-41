You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    '''
    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    '''
    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
    '''

    """
    Given a matrix represented as a list of lists, return the max of the n'th column.

    Args:
    test_list (list): A list of lists representing a matrix.
    N (int): The column number for which to find the maximum value.

    Returns:
    int: The maximum value in the Nth column of the matrix.
    """

    # Initialize a list to store the Nth column of the matrix.
    nth_col = []

    # Iterate over each row of the matrix and append the Nth element to the nth_col list.
    for row in test_list:
        nth_col.append(row[N])

    # Return the maximum value in the nth_col list.
    return max(nth_col)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_of_nth([[11, -20, 23], [42, -26, 15], [10, -12, 7]],1) == 42
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
