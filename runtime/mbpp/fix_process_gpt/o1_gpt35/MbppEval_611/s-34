You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    '''
    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    '''
    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
    '''

    """
    Given a matrix represented as a list of lists, this function returns the maximum element in the Nth column.

    Parameters:
    test_list (list): A matrix represented as a list of lists
    N (int): The index of the column whose maximum element is to be found

    Returns:
    int/float: The maximum element in the Nth column of the matrix
    """
    column = [row[N] for row in test_list]
    return max(column)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_of_nth([[11, -20, 23], [42, -26, 15], [10, -12, 7]],1) == 42
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    column = [row[N] for row in test_list]
    return max(column)
