You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    '''
    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    '''
    Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
    '''

    # Extracting the n'th column from the matrix
    column_values = [row[N-1] for row in test_list]
    
    # Finding the max value in the column
    max_value = max(column_values)
    
    # Returning the max value
    return max_value

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_of_nth([[-11, 20, -23], [-42, 26, -15], [-10, 12, -7]],1) == 26
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
