I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_Product(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find a pair with highest product from a given array of integers.
    '''
```

```python
def max_Product(arr): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find a pair with highest product from a given array of integers.
    '''
 
    # If the length of array is less than 2, return None
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return None

    # Initialize the first two elements of the array as max and min values
    max_val = arr[0]
    min_val = arr[1]

    # Initialize max product as the product of first two elements of the array
    max_product = max_val * min_val

    # Iterate over the array starting from the third element
    for i in range(2, len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element can create a higher product with the minimum value so far
        if arr[i] * min_val > max_product:
            max_product = arr[i] * min_val
        
        # Check if the current element can create a higher product with the maximum value so far
        elif arr[i] * max_val > max_product:
            max_product = arr[i] * max_val

        # Update the minimum and maximum values
        if arr[i] < min_val:
            min_val = arr[i]
        elif arr[i] > max_val:
            max_val = arr[i]

    # Return the maximum product
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_Product([7, -1, -2, 8, -2]) == (7, 8)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
