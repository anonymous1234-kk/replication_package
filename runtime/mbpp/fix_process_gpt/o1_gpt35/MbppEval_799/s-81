You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # Get the number of bits in the number n
    num_bits = 32
    
    # Left rotate the number by d bits
    # This is achieved by shifting the bits d places to the left
    # and then OR-ing the remaining bits with the original number shifted d places to the right
    left_shifted_num = (n << d) & (2 ** num_bits - 1)
    right_shifted_num = n >> (num_bits - d)
    rotated_num = left_shifted_num | right_shifted_num
    
    return rotated_num

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(-7,3) == 4294967295
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
assert left_rotate(256,8) == 65536
assert left_rotate(123456789,5) == 3950617248
assert left_rotate(4,4) == 64
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
