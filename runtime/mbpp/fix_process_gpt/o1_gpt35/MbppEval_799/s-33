You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # mask to get the d leftmost bits
    mask = (1 << d) - 1

    # shift the masked bits to the right
    masked_bits = (n & mask) << (32 - d)

    # shift the remaining bits to the left
    remaining_bits = n >> d

    # combine the masked bits and the remaining bits
    result = remaining_bits | masked_bits

    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
