I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # Shifting bits to the left by d bits 
    left_shifted = (n << d) 
      
    # Shifting bits to the right by (32 - d) bits  
    # and adding the remaining bits on the right 
    right_shifted = (n >> (32 - d)) 
    result = left_shifted | right_shifted 
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(72345678,10) == 1072773137
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
assert left_rotate(256,8) == 65536
assert left_rotate(123456789,5) == 3950617248
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
