You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # Shift the number n to the left by d bits and store the result in a variable
    left_shifted = (n << d)
    
    # Calculate the number of bits in n and store the result in a variable
    num_bits = 32
    
    # Mask the left-most d bits of the left-shifted number with 0s using bitwise AND and store the result in a variable
    mask = (2**num_bits - 1) ^ ((2**num_bits - 1) << d)
    masked = (left_shifted & mask)
    
    # Shift the masked number to the right by (num_bits - d) bits using bitwise right shift and store the result in a variable
    right_shifted = (masked >> (num_bits - d))
    
    # Combine the right-shifted and left-shifted numbers using bitwise OR and return the result
    return (right_shifted | left_shifted)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(-7,3) == 4294967295
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
assert left_rotate(256,8) == 65536
assert left_rotate(123456789,5) == 3950617248
assert left_rotate(4,4) == 64
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    left_shifted = (n << d)
    num_bits = 32
    mask = (2**num_bits - 1) ^ ((2**num_bits - 1) << d)
    masked = (left_shifted & mask)
    right_shifted = (masked >> (num_bits - d))
    return (right_shifted | (left_shifted & ~mask))
```
