I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''
```

```python
def left_rotate(n,d):   
    '''
    Write a function to that rotate left bits by d bits a given number. We assume that the number is 32 bit.
    '''

    # Since the number is 32-bit, we mask the bits to ensure that the number remains within 32-bit limit
    mask = (1 << 32) - 1
    # Left shift the number n by d bits and take the bitwise OR with the right shifted n by (32-d) bits
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & mask

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(-8,2) == 4294967267
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert left_rotate(400000000,2) == 1600000000
assert left_rotate(256,8) == 65536
assert left_rotate(123456789,5) == 3950617248
assert left_rotate(4,4) == 64
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert left_rotate(-2,3) == -9
