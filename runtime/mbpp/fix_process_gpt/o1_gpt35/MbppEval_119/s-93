You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''
```

```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''

    # Get the length of the array
    n = len(arr)
    
    # If the array has only one element, return it
    if n == 1:
        return arr[0]
    
    # Check for the first element
    if arr[0] != arr[1]:
        return arr[0]
    
    # Check for the last element
    if arr[-1] != arr[-2]:
        return arr[-1]
    
    # Binary search to find the element that appears only once
    left, right = 0, n-1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left+right) // 2
        if arr[mid] != arr[mid-1] and arr[mid] != arr[mid+1]:
            return arr[mid]
        elif arr[mid] == arr[mid-1]:

                right = mid - 2
            else:
                left = mid + 1

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert search([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 50, 50, 60, 60, 140, 140]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
