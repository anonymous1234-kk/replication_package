You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''
```

```python

    '''

    """

    """
    n = len(arr)
    # If the length of the array is zero or even, then return None
    if n == 0 or n % 2 == 0:
        return None

    # If the length of the array is 1, then return the only element in the array
    if n == 1:
        return arr[0]

    # Find the element that appears only once using binary search
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:

        if arr[mid] != arr[mid - 1] and arr[mid] != arr[mid + 1]:
            return arr[mid]

        # If the mid element is not the required element, then check which side to continue search
        if (mid % 2 == 0 and arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]) or (mid % 2 != 0 and arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]):
            left = mid + 1
        else:

    # Return None if the required element is not found
    return None

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert search([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 50, 50, 60, 60, 140, 140]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
