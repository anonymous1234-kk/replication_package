You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''
```

```python
def search(arr):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    '''

    """
    Write a python function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array.
    """
    # Iterate through the array starting at index 0
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):
        # Check if the current element is equal to the next element
        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            # If they are not equal, return the current element
            return arr[i]
    # If no element appears only once, return the last element of the array
    return arr[-1]

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert search([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 50, 50, 60, 60, 140, 150]) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
