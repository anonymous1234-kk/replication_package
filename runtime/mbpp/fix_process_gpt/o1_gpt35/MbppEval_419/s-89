You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def round_and_sum(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def round_and_sum(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
    '''

    # Round every number in the list
    rounded_list = [round(num) for num in list1]
    # Calculate the sum of the rounded list
    sum_of_rounded_list = sum(rounded_list)
    # Multiply the sum by the length of the list
    result = sum_of_rounded_list * len(list1)
    # Print the result
    print(result)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert round_and_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 126
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
