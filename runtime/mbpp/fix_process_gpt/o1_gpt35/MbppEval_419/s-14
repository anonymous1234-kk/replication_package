You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def round_and_sum(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def round_and_sum(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
    '''

    total_sum = 0
    for i in list1:
        total_sum += round(i)
    print(total_sum * len(list1))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert round_and_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 126
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
