You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def large_product(nums1, nums2, N):
    '''
    Write a function to find the specified number of largest products from two given lists, selecting one factor from each list.
    '''

    """
    Find the specified number of largest products from two given lists,
    selecting one factor from each list.

    Args:
    nums1 -- First list of numbers.
    nums2 -- Second list of numbers.
    N -- Number of largest products to find.

    Returns:
    A list of the specified number of largest products.
    """
    # Calculate the product of all possible pairs of elements from nums1 and nums2
    products = [a * b for a in nums1 for b in nums2]

    # Use a heap to efficiently find the N largest products
    largest_products = heapq.nlargest(N, products)

    return largest_products

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert large_product([1, 3, -5, 7, 8],[2, 4, 6, -9],3) == [48, 45, 42]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
