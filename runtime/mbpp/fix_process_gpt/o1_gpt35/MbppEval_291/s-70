I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
```

def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''

    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return k
    elif n == 2:
        return k * k
    
    # Total number of ways when n = 1
    same_color_count = k
    # Total number of ways when n = 2
    diff_color_count = k * k
    
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        # Calculate total number of ways when the current post has the same color as the previous post
        temp = diff_color_count
        diff_color_count = (same_color_count + diff_color_count) * (k-1)
        same_color_count = temp
        
    return same_color_count + diff_color_count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_no_of_ways(4,4) == 228
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
