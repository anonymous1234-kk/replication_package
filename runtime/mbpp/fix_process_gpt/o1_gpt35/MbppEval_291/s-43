I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
```

def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
 
    if n == 0:  # if there are no posts, there is only one way to paint the fence
        return 0
    elif n == 1:  # if there is only one post, there are k ways to paint the fence
        return k
    elif n == 2:  # if there are only two posts, there are k ways to paint the fence
        return k * k

    same_color_counts = k  # number of ways to paint the first two posts with the same color
    diff_color_counts = k * (k - 1)  # number of ways to paint the first two posts with different colors
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        prev_same_color_counts = same_color_counts  # save previous same color counts
        same_color_counts = diff_color_counts  # same color counts for current post is equal to different color counts for previous post
        diff_color_counts = (prev_same_color_counts + (k - 1) * diff_color_counts)  # different color counts for current post is sum of previous same color counts and different color counts multiplied by (k-1)
    return same_color_counts + diff_color_counts

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_no_of_ways(4,4) == 228
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
