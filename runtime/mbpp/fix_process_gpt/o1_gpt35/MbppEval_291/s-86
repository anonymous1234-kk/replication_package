I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
```

def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''

    if n == 0: # if there are no posts, there are no ways to paint the fence
        return 0
    elif n == 1: # if there is only one post, there are k ways to paint it
        return k
    elif n == 2: # if there are only two posts, there are k ways to paint the first post and k-1 ways to paint the second post, since we cannot use the same color as the first post
        return k * (k-1)
    else:
        # if there are more than two posts, we can paint the third post in (k-1) ways, since we cannot use the same color as the second post
        # for the remaining posts, we can either use the same color as the previous post or a different color. If we use the same color, we cannot use the same color for the previous two posts, so we have (k-1) ways to choose the color. If we use a different color, we have (k-1)*(k-2) ways to choose the color, since we cannot use the color of the previous post or the color of the previous two posts
        # Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the fence is the product of the number of ways to paint the third post and the number of ways to paint the remaining posts
        prev2 = k * (k-1)
        prev1 = k
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            curr = (k-1) * (prev1 + (k-1)*prev2)
            prev2 = prev1
            prev1 = curr
        return prev1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_no_of_ways(4,4) == 228
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
