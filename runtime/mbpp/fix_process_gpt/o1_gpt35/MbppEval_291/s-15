You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
```

def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
 
    if n <= 0 or k <= 0:
        return 0
        
    if n == 1:
        return k

    same_color_counts = [0] * n
    different_color_counts = [0] * n

    same_color_counts[0] = k
    different_color_counts[0] = k

    for i in range(1, n):
        same_color_counts[i] = different_color_counts[i-1]
        different_color_counts[i] = (k-1) * same_color_counts[i-1] + (k-1) * different_color_counts[i-1]

    return same_color_counts[n-1] + different_color_counts[n-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_no_of_ways(4,4) == 228
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
