I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''
```

def count_no_of_ways(n, k): 
    '''
    Write a function to find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color for the given fence with n posts and k colors.
    '''

    if n == 0: # If there are no posts, there is no way to paint the fence
        return 0
    elif n == 1: # If there is only one post, there are k ways to paint the fence
        return k
    elif n == 2: # If there are two posts, there are k ways to paint the first post and k-1 ways to paint the second post as they cannot have the same color
        return k * (k - 1)
    else: # For all other cases, we use dynamic programming to compute the number of ways
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[1] = k
        dp[2] = k * (k - 1)
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
        return dp[n]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_no_of_ways(4,4) == 228
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
