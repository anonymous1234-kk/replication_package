You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether all the bits are unset in the given range or not.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether all the bits are unset in the given range or not.
    '''

    # Left shift '1' by 'r' times and subtract 1 from it to get a number with 'r' bits set
    # Then, left shift that number by 'l-1' times to get a number with all the bits set in the given range
    # Finally, check whether the bitwise AND of 'n' and that number is zero or not
    return (n & ((1 << r) - 1) << (l - 1)) == 0

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(9,0,3) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
