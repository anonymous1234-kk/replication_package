You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(n,l,r):  
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether all the bits are unset in the given range or not.
    '''
```

    '''
    # left shift 1 by r times and subtract 1 from it
    # to create a number which has r bits set starting
    # from the rightmost bit

    # 0b00000111 (binary representation of 7)
    right_mask = (1 << r) - 1

    # left shift 1 by (l-1) times and subtract 1 from it
    # to create a number which has l-1 bits set starting
    # from the rightmost bit

    # 0b00000001 (binary representation of 1)
    left_mask = (1 << (l-1)) - 1

    # combine the left and right masks to create a number
    # which has all bits set in the given range
    # For example, if l = 2 and r = 3, then we create the
    # number 0b00000110 (binary representation of 6)
    mask = right_mask ^ left_mask

    # if bitwise AND of n and mask is equal to 0,
    # then all bits in the given range are unset

    else:
        return False

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range(9,0,3) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
