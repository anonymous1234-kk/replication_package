You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def surfacearea_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function to find the surface area of a cylinder.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surfacearea_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function to find the surface area of a cylinder.
    '''

    surface_area = 2 * 3.14 * r * h + 2 * 3.14 * r**2
    return surface_area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surfacearea_cylinder(2,3) == 62.83185307179586
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
