I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to count the number of lists within a list. The function should return a dictionary, where every list is turned to a tuple, and the value of the tuple is the number of its occurrences.
    '''
```

    '''

    '''

    unique_lst = {}
    for lst in list1:
        if tuple(lst) in unique_lst:
            unique_lst[tuple(lst)] += 1
        else:
            unique_lst[tuple(lst)] = 1
    return unique_lst

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert unique_sublists(['sam', [1, 2], 3, 4, [1, 2], 'john', 'mike', [1, 2], 'john']) == {(1, 2): 3}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    unique_lst = {}
    for lst in list1:
        if isinstance(lst, list):  # check if the element is a list
            if tuple(lst) in unique_lst:
                unique_lst[tuple(lst)] += 1
            else:
                unique_lst[tuple(lst)] = 1
    return unique_lst
```
