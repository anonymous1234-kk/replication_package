I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to count the number of lists within a list. The function should return a dictionary, where every list is turned to a tuple, and the value of the tuple is the number of its occurrences.
    '''
```

    # Initialize an empty dictionary

        sublist_tuple = tuple(sublist)
        
        # If the tuple exists in the dictionary, increment its value
        if sublist_tuple in count_dict:
            count_dict[sublist_tuple] += 1
        # Otherwise, add the tuple to the dictionary with a value of 1
        else:
            count_dict[sublist_tuple] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary
    return count_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert unique_sublists(['sam', [1, 2], 3, 4, [1, 2], 'john', 'mike', [1, 2], 'john']) == {(1, 2): 3}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

        if isinstance(sublist, list):  # Check if the element is a list
