I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to count the number of lists within a list. The function should return a dictionary, where every list is turned to a tuple, and the value of the tuple is the number of its occurrences.
    '''
```

    """

    and the value of the tuple is the number of its occurrences.

    # Create an empty dictionary
    dict_count = {}

    # Loop through the input list
    for sublist in list1:
        # Convert the sublist to a tuple
        sublist_tuple = tuple(sublist)
        # Check if the tuple exists in the dictionary
        if sublist_tuple in dict_count:
            # If the tuple exists, increment its count
            dict_count[sublist_tuple] += 1
        else:
            # If the tuple does not exist, add it to the dictionary with count 1
            dict_count[sublist_tuple] = 1

    # Return the dictionary
    return dict_count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert unique_sublists(['sam', [1, 2], 3, 4, [1, 2], 'john', 'mike', [1, 2], 'john']) == {(1, 2): 3}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
