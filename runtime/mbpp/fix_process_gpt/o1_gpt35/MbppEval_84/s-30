You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''
```

```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''
 
    if n == 0 or n == 1: 
        return 1
    else:
        arr = [0] * (n + 1)
        arr[1] = 1
        arr[2] = 1
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            arr[i] = arr[arr[i - 1]] + arr[i - arr[i - 1]]
        return arr[n]
```

Note: The Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of integers where each term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the sequence are 1 and 1. The sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
```
P(1) = 1
P(2) = 1
for n > 2: P(n) = P(P(n - 1)) + P(n - P(n - 1))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sequence(8) == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
