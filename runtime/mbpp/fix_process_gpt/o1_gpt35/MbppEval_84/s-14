You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''
```

```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''

    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        seq = [0] * (n+1)
        seq[1] = 1
        seq[2] = 1
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]
        return seq[n]
```

This function implements the Newman-Conway sequence, which is a sequence of integers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence, except that the indices of the two numbers are taken from the value of the previous number in the sequence. 

For example, the first few numbers in the sequence are:

```
1 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 7 7 8 8 8 9 10 11 12 12 12 12 13 14 ...

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sequence(8) == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
