I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sequence(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
    '''

    # Base cases
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case
    else:
        return sequence(sequence(n - 1)) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sequence(25) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert sequence(8) == 4
assert sequence(9) == 5
assert sequence(10) == 6
assert sequence(3) == 2
assert sequence(6) == 4
assert sequence(1) == 1
assert sequence(12) == 7
assert sequence(20) == 12
assert sequence(15) == 8
assert sequence(17) == 9
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
