I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import math 
def div_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to determine if the sum of the divisors of two integers are the same.
    '''
 
    # Find all divisors of n and calculate their sum
    sum1 = sum([i for i in range(1, n+1) if n%i == 0])
    
    # Find all divisors of 2n and calculate their sum
    sum2 = sum([i for i in range(1, 2*n+1) if (2*n)%i == 0])
    
    # Compare the two sums and return True if they are equal, False otherwise
    return sum1 == sum2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert div_sum(1184) == 1210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
