You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''

    # Initializing the count variable to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through the tuple elements
    for i in range(len(test_tup)):
        # If the current element is a tuple, break the loop
        if isinstance(test_tup[i], tuple):
            break
        # Otherwise, increment the count variable
        else:
            count += 1
                
    # Return the count variable
    return count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_first_elements(((1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5))) == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Sure, I apologize for the mistake. Here's the fixed code:

        result.append(count)

```

Please note that the code you provided doesn't have a second argument for the function `count_first_elements()`. If you intended to pass a second argument, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist further.
