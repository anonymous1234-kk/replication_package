I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(test_tup)):
        if isinstance(test_tup[i], tuple):
            return count
        count += 1
    return count
