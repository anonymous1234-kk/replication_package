I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def count_first_elements(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
    '''

    count = 0  # initialize the counter to zero
    for i in range(len(test_tup)):
        if test_tup[i] == test_tup[0]:  # check if the current element is the first element
            return count  # if it is, return the current count
        else:
            count += 1  # if not, increment the count
    return count  # if the first element is not found, return the length of the tuple
