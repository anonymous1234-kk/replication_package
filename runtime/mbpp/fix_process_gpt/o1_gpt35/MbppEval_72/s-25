I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def dif_Square(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def dif_Square(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not.
    '''

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if i*i - j*j == n:
                return True
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert dif_Square(14) == No
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
