I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def dif_Square(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not.
    '''
```

```python
def dif_Square(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not.
    '''
 
    for i in range(1, n):         # iterate over the range of 1 to n
        for j in range(i+1, n):   # iterate over the range of i+1 to n
            if (j*j - i*i == n):  # check if the difference of two squares is equal to n
                return True      # return True if n can be represented as the difference of two squares
    return False                 # return False if n cannot be represented as the difference of two squares

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert dif_Square(14) == No
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
