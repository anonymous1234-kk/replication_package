You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/
    '''
```

    return [comb for i in range(1,len(test_list)+1) for comb in combinations(test_list,i)]

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_combinations([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)]) == [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/
    '''

    return [sum(comb) for i in range(1,len(test_list)+1) for comb in combinations(test_list,i)]
```

The fixed code should pass the provided test case as well as the previously passed test cases.
