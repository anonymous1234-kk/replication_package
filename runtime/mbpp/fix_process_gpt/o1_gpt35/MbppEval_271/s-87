I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_Power_Sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and finds the sum of the first n even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power.
    '''
```

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in an integer n and finds the sum of the first n even natural numbers that are raised to the fifth power.
    '''

    sum_of_powers = 0  # Initialize the variable to store the sum of even numbers raised to power 5
    
    for i in range(1, n*2+1, 2):  # Iterate over the even numbers from 1 to 2*n
        sum_of_powers += i**5  # Add the ith even number to the sum_of_powers variable
    
    return sum_of_powers  # Return the final sum of the even numbers raised to power 5

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_Power_Sum(4) == 41600
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
