You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''
```

```python
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.
    '''
    # Initialize an empty heap
    heap = []
    # Push the first n elements onto the heap
    for i in range(n):
        hq.heappush(heap, nums[i])
    # For the rest of the elements, if they are greater than the smallest element in the heap, push them onto the heap
    for i in range(n, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > heap[0]:
            hq.heappop(heap)
            hq.heappush(heap, nums[i])
    # Return the n largest elements in descending order
    return sorted(heap, reverse=True)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert heap_queue_largest([1],2) == [1]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
