You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_Max_Num(arr) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_Max_Num(arr) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.
    '''
 
    # sort the array in non-increasing order
    arr.sort(reverse = True)
  
    # join the array to form the number
    num = ''.join([str(i) for i in arr])
  
    # return the number
    return int(num)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_Max_Num([90, 34, 6, 7, 89]) == 90897634
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_Max_Num([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) == 9876543110
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
