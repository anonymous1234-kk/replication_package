You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    """
    Get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    """
    lucid_numbers = [1]
    i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0
    next_lucid = 2
    while next_lucid <= n:
        lucid_numbers.append(next_lucid)
        next_lucid = min(2*lucid_numbers[i2], 3*lucid_numbers[i3], 5*lucid_numbers[i5])
        if next_lucid == 2*lucid_numbers[i2]:
            i2 += 1
        if next_lucid == 3*lucid_numbers[i3]:
            i3 += 1
        if next_lucid == 5*lucid_numbers[i5]:
            i5 += 1
    return lucid_numbers

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
