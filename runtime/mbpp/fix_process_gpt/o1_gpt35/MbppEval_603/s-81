You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''
```

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    '''
    Write a function to get all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer.
    '''

    """
    This function returns all ludic numbers smaller than or equal to n.
    A ludic number is a number that can be formed by iterating over a sequence of numbers,
    where the first number is 1 and each subsequent number is the next prime number greater than
    the previous number in the sequence.
    """
    primes = [2]
    ludic = [1]
    i = 2
    while i <= n:
        if all(i % p != 0 for p in primes):
            primes.append(i)
            if i <= n:
                ludic.append(i)
        i += 1
    i = 1
    while i < len(ludic):
        j = ludic[i] - 1
        while j >= i:
            ludic.pop(j)
            j -= i
        i += 1
    return ludic

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_ludic(2) == [1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_ludic(1) == [1]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
