I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_Element(arr,ranges,rotations,index) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find element at a given index after number of rotations.

Certainly! Here's the fixed code:

```python
def find_Element(arr,ranges,rotations,index) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find element at a given index after number of rotations.
    '''

    # Calculate the actual rotations needed based on the length of the array
    rotations = rotations % len(arr)
    
    # Traverse the given ranges and perform rotations
    for r in ranges:
        # Perform the rotations for the current range
        for i in range(rotations):
            # Move the last element to the beginning
            temp = arr[r[1]]
            for j in range(r[1], r[0], -1):
                arr[j] = arr[j-1]
            arr[r[0]] = temp
    
    # Return the element at the given index
    return arr[index]


assert find_Element([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[(0, 2), (0, 3)],1,0) == 3
```

The fixed code should pass the provided test case as well as the previously passed test cases.
