You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_Element(arr,ranges,rotations,index) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find element at a given index after number of rotations.
    '''
```

```python
def find_Element(arr,ranges,rotations,index) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find element at a given index after number of rotations.
    '''
  
    for i in range(rotations): 
        x = arr.pop(0) 
        arr.append(x) 

    for i in ranges:

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_Element([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[(0, 1), (4, 5)],1,1) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
