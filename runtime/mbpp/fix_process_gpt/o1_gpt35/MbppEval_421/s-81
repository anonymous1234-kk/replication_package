You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def concatenate_tuple(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to concatenate each element of tuple by the delimiter.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def concatenate_tuple(test_tup):
    '''
    Write a function to concatenate each element of tuple by the delimiter.
    '''

    delimiter = "-"
    return delimiter.join(map(str, test_tup))

```
