I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def and_tuples(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def and_tuples(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
    '''
    # Use zip to get elementwise tuples
    zip_tuple = zip(test_tup1, test_tup2)
    # Use list comprehension to get tuples with and of elements
    and_tuple = [(x and y,) for (x,y) in zip_tuple]
    # Return the list of tuples
    return and_tuple

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert and_tuples(('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'),('a', 'b')) == ('a', 'b')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
