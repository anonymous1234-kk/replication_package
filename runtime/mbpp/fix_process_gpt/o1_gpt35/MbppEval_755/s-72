You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''

    # Sort the numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Return the second element in the sorted list
    return numbers[1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert second_smallest([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    '''
    Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
    '''

    # Sort the numbers in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Find the first number that is different from the smallest number
    for num in numbers:
        if num != numbers[0]:
            return num

    # If all numbers are the same, return the smallest number
    return numbers[0]
```
