You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def circle_circumference(r):
    '''
    Write a function to find the circumference of a circle.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def circle_circumference(r):
    '''
    Write a function to find the circumference of a circle.
    '''

    # Formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * pi * r
    pi = 3.14159
    circumference = 2 * pi * r
    return circumference

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert circle_circumference(10) == 62.83185307179586
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
