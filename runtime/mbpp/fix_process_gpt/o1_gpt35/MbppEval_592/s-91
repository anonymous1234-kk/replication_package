I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
 
    res = 0
    for i in range(k+1): 
        term = math.comb(n,i) * math.comb(n-i,k-i) 
        res += term 
    return res

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(0,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
