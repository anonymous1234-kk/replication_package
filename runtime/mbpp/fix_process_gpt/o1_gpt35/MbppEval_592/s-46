You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
 
    # Initialize result 
    result = 0
  
    # A simple loop to compute  
    # individual Binomial Coefficients 
    for i in range(k,n+1): 
        res = 1
        for j in range(1,i+1): 
  
            # Update result 
            result += res 
  
            # res yet contains the product of 
            # numbers upto i. We multiply it 
            # with (n-i)/i to make it product 
            # of consecutive numbers upto n 
            res *= (n-j) 
            res /= j 
  
    return result 

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(0,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
