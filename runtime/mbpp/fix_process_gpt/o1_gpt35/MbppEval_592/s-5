I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''

    result = 0
    for i in range(k):
        result += (n-i) * (i+1)
    return result
```

This function will take two arguments n and k, and will return the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients using the given formula:

```
(n choose k) * (n-i choose i)
```

We can simplify this formula as follows:

```
(n-i+1)/(i) * (n choose k)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(0,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
