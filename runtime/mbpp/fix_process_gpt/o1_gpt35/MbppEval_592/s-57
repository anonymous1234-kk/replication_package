You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
    # Initialize result
    result = 0
  
    # A simple formula to compute 
    # individual binomial coefficient
    for i in range(k):
        res = 1
        for j in range(i,n):
  
            # The following two lines 
            # are similar to int C(n,k)
            # but avoid overflow
            res *= j
            res //= j - i
  
            if j - i == k - 1:
                result += res
                break
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(0,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
