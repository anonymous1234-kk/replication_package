You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''

    # initialize result
    result = 0
 
    # Iterate through all possible pairs (i, j)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            # Calculate binomial coefficient for i and j
            coef_i = 1
            coef_j = 1
            for m in range(1, k+1):
                coef_i *= (i+m)
                coef_j *= (j+m)
                coef_i //= m
                coef_j //= m
            # Add product of binomial coefficients to result
            result += coef_i * coef_j
 
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert binomial_Coeff(0,0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
