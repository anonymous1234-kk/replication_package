I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def binomial_Coeff(n,k): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.
    '''

    # Initialize result
    result = 0
 
    # A temporary variable to store individual
    # binomial coefficients
    res = 1
 
    # Sum of product of consecutive binomial
    # coefficients
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        res *= (n-i+1)
        res /= i
        result += res
