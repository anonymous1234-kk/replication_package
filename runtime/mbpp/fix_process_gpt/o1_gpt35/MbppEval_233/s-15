Here is the question.
```python
def lateralsuface_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cylinder.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def lateralsuface_cylinder(r,h):
    '''
    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cylinder.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cylinder.
    '''
    # Formula to calculate lateral surface area of a cylinder is 2 * pi * r * h
    lateral_surface_area = 2 * 3.14 * r * h
    
    return lateral_surface_area

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert lateralsuface_cylinder(4,8) == 201.06192982974676
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
