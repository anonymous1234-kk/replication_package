You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def Find_Min(lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def Find_Min(lst): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length.
    '''
    min_length = len(lst[0])
    for sublist in lst:
        if len(sublist) < min_length:
            min_length = len(sublist)
            min_sublist = sublist
    return min_sublist

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert Find_Min(['apple', 'banana']) == apple
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert Find_Min(['apple', 'mango', 'banana', 'kiwi']) == kiwi
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
