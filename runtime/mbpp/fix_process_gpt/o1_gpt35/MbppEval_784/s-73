I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def mul_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def mul_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even_product = 1
    odd_product = 1
    for num in list1:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_product *= num
        else:
            odd_product *= num
        if even_product != 1 and odd_product != 1:
            break
    return even_product * odd_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert mul_even_odd([3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 2, 4]) == 30
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert mul_even_odd([3, 4, 6, 9, 1, 2]) == 12
assert mul_even_odd([3, 6, 7, 8, 15, 20, 25, 36]) == 18
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
