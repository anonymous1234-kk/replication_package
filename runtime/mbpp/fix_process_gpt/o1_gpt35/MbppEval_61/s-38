I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
    # Define a dictionary to store the frequency of each prefix sum
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Initialize the count of substrings to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Initialize the prefix sum to 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through each character in the string s
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Convert the character to an integer and add it to the prefix sum
        prefix_sum += int(s[i])
        
        # If the prefix sum equals the current index + 1, increment the count of substrings
        count += freq[prefix_sum - (i + 1)]
        
        # Increment the frequency of the current prefix sum
        freq[prefix_sum - (i + 1)] += 1
    
    # Return the count of substrings
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
