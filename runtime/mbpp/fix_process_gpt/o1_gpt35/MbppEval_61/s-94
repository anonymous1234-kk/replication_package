You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

        counter += prefix_sum_freq[prefix_sum - i - 1]
        # If the prefix sum is equal to the current index, increment the counter
        if prefix_sum == i + 1:
            counter += 1
        # Increment the frequency of the current prefix sum
        prefix_sum_freq[prefix_sum] += 1

    # Return the final count
    return counter

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
