I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def count_Substrings(s):
    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to count the number of substrings with the sum of digits equal to their length.
    '''
    count = 0
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of all possible sums
    sum_counts = defaultdict(int)

    # Iterate over all substrings of the given string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(s)+1):
            # Calculate the sum of digits in the current substring
            digit_sum = sum([int(digit) for digit in s[i:j]])

            # If the sum is equal to the length of the substring, increment the count
            if digit_sum == (j-i):
                count += 1

            # Increment the count of the current sum in the dictionary
            sum_counts[digit_sum] += 1

    # Calculate the total count of substrings with sum of digits equal to length
    total_count = sum_counts[len(s)]

    # Subtract the count of all substrings with sum of digits less than length
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        total_count -= sum_counts[i]

    return total_count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_Substrings('1234567') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
