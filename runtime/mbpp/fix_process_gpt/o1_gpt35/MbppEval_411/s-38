You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert the given snake case string to camel case string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert the given snake case string to camel case string.
    '''

    # Split the snake case string by underscore and capitalize the first letter of each word except the first word
    return ''.join(word.title().split('_'))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert snake_to_camel('happy_24_grocery') == happy24Grocery
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
