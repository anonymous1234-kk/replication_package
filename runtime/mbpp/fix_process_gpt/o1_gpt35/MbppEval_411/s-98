I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert snake_to_camel('123_23_') == 12323
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
