I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert the given snake case string to camel case string.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def snake_to_camel(word):
    '''
    Write a function to convert the given snake case string to camel case string.
    '''

    # split the string at underscores
    parts = word.split('_')
    
    # convert the first letter of each part to uppercase and join them
    # using an empty string as the separator
    camel_case = ''.join([part.capitalize() for part in parts])
    
    # return the camel case string
    return camel_case

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert snake_to_camel('happy_24_grocery') == happy24Grocery
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
