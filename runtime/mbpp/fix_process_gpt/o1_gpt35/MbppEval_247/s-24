You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def lps(str): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string.
    '''
```

```python
def lps(str): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string.
    '''
 
    n = len(str)
    L = [[0 for x in range(n)] for x in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        L[i][i] = 1

    for cl in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(n-cl+1):
            j = i+cl-1
            if str[i] == str[j] and cl == 2:
                L[i][j] = 2
            elif str[i] == str[j]:
                L[i][j] = L[i+1][j-1] + 2
            else:
                L[i][j] = max(L[i][j-1], L[i+1][j]);

    return L[0][n-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert lps('longest palindromic sequence') == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert lps('abcda') == 3
assert lps('hello world') == 5
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
