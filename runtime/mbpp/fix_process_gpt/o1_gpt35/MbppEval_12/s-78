I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def sort_matrix(M):
    '''
    Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def sort_matrix(M):
    '''
    Write a function to sort a given matrix in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
    '''

    # Calculate the sums of each row of the matrix
    row_sums = [sum(row) for row in M]
    
    # Sort the matrix by the row sums
    sorted_M = [row for _, row in sorted(zip(row_sums, M))]
    
    return sorted_M

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sort_matrix([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]) == [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert sort_matrix([[1, 4, 6], [2, 5, 7], [3, 8, 9], [4, 6, 9]]) == [[1, 4, 6], [2, 5, 7], [4, 6, 9], [3, 8, 9]]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
