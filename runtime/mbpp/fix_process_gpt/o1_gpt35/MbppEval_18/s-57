You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''

    # create a list to store the frequency of each character
    freq = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # iterate through the second string and update the frequency list
    for char in string2:
        freq[ord(char)] += 1
    
    # create an empty list to store the output
    result = []
    
    # iterate through the first string and add characters to the output list
    # only if they are not present in the frequency list
    for char in string1:
        if freq[ord(char)] == 0:
            result.append(char)
    
    # convert the output list to a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
