I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python

def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a list of size 256 to keep track of each character in the second string
    second_str_chars = [False] * NO_OF_CHARS

    # Mark each character in the second string as True in the list
    for char in string:
        second_str_chars[ord(char)] = True

    # Create an empty list to store the filtered characters
    filtered_chars = []

    # Iterate through each character in the first string
    for char in string:
        # Check if the character is present in the second string
        if not second_str_chars[ord(char)]:
            # If the character is not present, add it to the filtered_chars list
            filtered_chars.append(char)

    # Return the filtered_chars list as a string
    return ''.join(filtered_chars)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
