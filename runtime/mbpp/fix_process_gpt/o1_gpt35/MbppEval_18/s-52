You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

def str_to_list(string): 
    '''

    '''

    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Initialize the count array to store count of characters
    count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
 
    # Count frequency of all characters in the second string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        count[ord(string[i])] += 1
 
    # Create an empty string to store the filtered string
    filtered_string = ""
 
    # Iterate through the first string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # If the current character is not present in the second string, add it to the filtered string
        if count[ord(string[i])] == 0:
            filtered_string += string[i]
 
    return filtered_string

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
