You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
 
    # Initialize count array with zeros
    count = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS

    # Convert second string to a set for faster lookup
    second_set = set(second)

    # Iterate through first string
    for char in string:
        # If character is not in the second string, add it to the result string
        if char not in second_set:
            result_string += char

    # Return the result string
    return result_string

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
