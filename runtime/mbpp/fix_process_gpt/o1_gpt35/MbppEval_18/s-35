I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''

    # create a character list with the size of NO_OF_CHARS
    char_list = [0] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # iterate through each character in the second string and set its corresponding value in the char_list to 1
    for char in string:
        char_list[ord(char)] = 1
    
    # create an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    # iterate through each character in the first string and add it to the result string if its corresponding value in the char_list is 0
    for char in string:
        if char_list[ord(char)] == 0:
            result += char
            
    # return the result string
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
