I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.

    # Create a list to store the characters of the first string that are not present in the second string
    result = []
    
    # Create a boolean list to keep track of characters in the second string
    # Initialize all elements as False
    count = [False] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # Iterate through each character in the second string
    for i in range(len(string2)):

        count[ord(string2[i])] = True

    for i in range(len(string1)):
        # If the character is not present in the second string, append it to the result list
        if not count[ord(string1[i])]:
            result.append(string1[i])
    
    # Return the result list
    return result

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
