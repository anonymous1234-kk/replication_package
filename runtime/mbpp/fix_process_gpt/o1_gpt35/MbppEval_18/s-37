You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
NO_OF_CHARS = 256
def str_to_list(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
```

    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.
    '''
    # Create a boolean array to store if a character is present in the second string or not
    char_present = [False] * NO_OF_CHARS
    
    # Iterate over the second string and mark characters as present
    for char in string:
        char_present[ord(char)] = True
    
    # Create an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over the first string and append non-matching characters to the result
    for char in string:
        if not char_present[ord(char)]:
            result += char
    
    # Return the result
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert str_to_list('mask','geeksforgeeks') == ma
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
