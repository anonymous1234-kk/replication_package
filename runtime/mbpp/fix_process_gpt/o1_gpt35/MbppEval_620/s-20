I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    max_count = 0
    
    # Loop through all possible subsets of a
    for i in range(1, 2**len(a)):
        subset = [a[j] for j in range(len(a)) if i & (1 << j)]
        
        # Check if every pair in the subset is divisible
        divisible = True
        for x in subset:
            for y in subset:
                if x % y != 0 and y % x != 0:
                    divisible = False
                    break
            if not divisible:
                break
        
        # If the subset is divisible and larger than the current max, update the max count
        if divisible and len(subset) > max_count:
            max_count = len(subset)
    
    return max_count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]) == 5
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 3]) == 2
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 6, 9]) == 2
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 4
assert largest_subset([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]) == 3
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 5, 10, 20, 21]) == 3
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
