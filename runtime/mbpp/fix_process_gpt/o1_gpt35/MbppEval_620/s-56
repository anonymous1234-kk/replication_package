I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    # Initialize the result to 0
    result = 0
    
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the sizes of the subsets
    subsets = {}
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in a:
        # Create an empty list to store the sizes of the subsets that can be extended by the current number
        sizes = []
        
        # Iterate over each subset size in the dictionary
        for size in subsets:
            # Check if the current number is divisible by every number in the subset
            if all(num % n == 0 for n in subsets[size]):
                # If the number is divisible by every number in the subset, add the size of the subset to the list of sizes
                sizes.append(size)
        
        # If there are any sizes in the list of sizes, extend the smallest subset by the current number
        if sizes:
            size = min(sizes)
            subsets[size + 1] = subsets[size] + [num]
            del subsets[size]
        # If there are no sizes in the list of sizes, create a new subset with the current number
        else:
            subsets[1] = [num]
        
        # Update the result to the size of the largest subset
        result = max(result, len(subsets[max(subsets)]))
    
    # Return the size of the largest subset
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20]) == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 3]) == 2
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 6, 9]) == 2
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 4
assert largest_subset([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]) == 3
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31]) == 4
assert largest_subset([3, 5, 10, 20, 21]) == 3
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]) == 5
assert largest_subset([2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20]) == 4
assert largest_subset([1, 5, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29]) == 3
assert largest_subset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]) == 4
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

        result = max(result, len(subsets[max(subsets)]))
