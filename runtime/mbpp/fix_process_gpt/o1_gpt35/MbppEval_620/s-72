You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def largest_subset(a):
    '''
    Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    '''

    """
    Returns the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
    
    Parameters:
    a (list): A list of integers.

    Returns:
    int: The size of the largest subset of a so that every pair is divisible.
    """
    n = len(a)
    dp = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if a[i] % a[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

Here is an example of how to use the function:

```python
a = [2, 3, 8, 9, 27]
print(largest_subset(a))  # Output: 3

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert largest_subset([1, 3]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
