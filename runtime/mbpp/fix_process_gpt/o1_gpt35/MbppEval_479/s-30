I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def first_Digit(n) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the first digit of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def first_Digit(n) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the first digit of a given number.
    '''

    # Get the absolute value of the input number
    n = abs(n)
    
    # Keep dividing the number by 10 until it becomes less than 10
    while n >= 10:
        n //= 10
    
    # Return the first digit of the number
    return n

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert first_Digit(2.34e-06) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert first_Digit(-9.3) == 9
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
