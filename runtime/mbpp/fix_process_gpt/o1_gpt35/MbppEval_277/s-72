I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def dict_filter(dict,n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
    '''
```

```python
def dict_filter(dict,n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
    '''

    filtered_dict = {}
    for key, value in d.items():
        if value >= n:
            filtered_dict[key] = value
    return filtered_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert dict_filter({1: 1, 'two': 2},1) == {1: 1, 'two': 2}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
