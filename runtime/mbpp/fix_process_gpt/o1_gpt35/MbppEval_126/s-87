Please note that the code had an error in the last line. We need to rename the variable `sum` to something else, as `sum` is a built-in function in Python. Let's rename it to `total`.

```python

The issue in the code is that the variable `result` is being calculated using the built-in function `sum()` instead of using the sum of the common divisors stored in the `divisors` set. To fix it, we can change `result = sum(divisors)` to `result = sum(divisors)`.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
def sum(a,b): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers.
