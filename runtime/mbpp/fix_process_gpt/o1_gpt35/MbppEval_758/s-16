You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to count lists within a list. The function should return a dictionary where every list is converted to a tuple and the value of such tuple is the number of its occurencies in the original list.
    '''
```

    return count_dict

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert unique_sublists(['hello', 'hi', 'hi', 'hello']) == {}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert unique_sublists([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]) == {(1, 2, 3): 1, (1, 2, 3, 4): 1}
assert unique_sublists([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], ['a', 'b']]) == {(1, 2, 3): 1, (1, 2, 3, 4): 1, ('a', 'b'): 1}
assert unique_sublists([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]) == {(1, 2): 1, (2, 3): 1, (3, 4): 1}
assert unique_sublists([[1], [2], [3]]) == {(1,): 1, (2,): 1, (3,): 1}
assert unique_sublists([[1, 2], [2, 3]]) == {(1, 2): 1, (2, 3): 1}
assert unique_sublists([[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2]]) == {(1, 2): 2, (2, 3): 1}
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

        count_dict[tuple(sublist)] = count_dict.get(tuple(sublist), 0) + 1
