Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # We create a mask with all even bits set to 1
    # For a 32-bit integer, the mask is 0xAAAAAAAA
    mask = 0xAAAAAAAA
    
    # We apply the mask to the input number, setting all even bits to the corresponding bit of the mask
    result = n | mask
    
    # We return the final result
