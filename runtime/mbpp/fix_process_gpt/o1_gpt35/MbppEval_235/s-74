I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # Binary representation of n
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Make the length of binary a multiple of 2
    if len(binary) % 2 == 1:
        binary = '0' + binary
    
    # Change all even bits to 1
    result = ''
    for i in range(0, len(binary), 2):
        result += '1' + binary[i+1]
    
    # Convert the binary string to integer
    return int(result, 2)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 1431655767
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
