I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # First we create a mask with all even bits set to 1
    mask = 0b0101010101010101
    
    # We perform a bitwise AND operation between the mask and the input number
    # This sets all even bits of the input number to 1
    result = n & mask
    
    return result
