You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # The binary representation of the number is obtained using the bin() function. 
    # We are interested in the bits 0, 2, 4, and so on. 
    # These bits can be obtained by slicing the binary string.
    # We set these bits to 1 using the bitwise OR operator (|).
    return int(''.join(['1' if i%2!=0 else b for i, b in enumerate(bin(n)[2:].zfill(32))]), 2)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(5) == 5
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
