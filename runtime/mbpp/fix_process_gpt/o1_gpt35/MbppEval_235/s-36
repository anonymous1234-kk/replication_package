I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # create a mask that has all the even bits set to 1
    mask = 0b0101010101010101
    # perform bitwise AND between the mask and the number
    # to set all the even bits to 1 and all odd bits to 0
    result = n & mask
    # return the result
    return result
