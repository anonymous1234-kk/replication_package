You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # binary representation of the number
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # making sure the binary string has even length
    if len(binary) % 2 != 0:
        binary = '0' + binary

    # iterating over the even indices and setting the bits to 1
    for i in range(0, len(binary), 2):
        binary = binary[:i] + '1' + binary[i+1:]

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 1431655767

 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
