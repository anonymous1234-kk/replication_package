I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # Finding the number of bits in the given number
    num_bits = n.bit_length()
    
    # Creating a bitmask with even bits set to 1
    mask = 0
    for i in range(0, num_bits, 2):
        mask |= 1 << i
    
    # Setting the even bits of the number using bitwise OR
    result = n | mask
    
    # Returning the result
    return result

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 1431655767
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
