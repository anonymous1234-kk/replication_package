You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # Binary representation of given number
    binary = bin(n)[2:]

    # Add zeroes to the left of the binary representation, if necessary
    binary = binary.zfill(len(binary) + (len(binary) % 2))

    # Replace even positions with 1
    binary = ''.join(['1' if i % 2 == 0 else binary[i] for i in range(len(binary))])

    # Convert binary representation to integer
    result = int(binary, 2)

    return result
