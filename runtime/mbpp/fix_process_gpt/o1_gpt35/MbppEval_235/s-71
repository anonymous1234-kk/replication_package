I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # Binary representation of the given number
    binary = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Add leading zeroes if necessary
    while len(binary) % 2 != 0:
        binary = '0' + binary
    
    # Convert binary string to a list of characters
    binary_list = list(binary)
    
    # Set even bits to 1
    for i in range(0, len(binary_list), 2):
        binary_list[i] = '1'
        
    # Convert binary list back to a string and then to an integer
    binary_str = ''.join(binary_list)
    result = int(binary_str, 2)
    
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 1431655767
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
