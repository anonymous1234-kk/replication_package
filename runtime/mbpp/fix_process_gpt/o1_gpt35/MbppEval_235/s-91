You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # Binary representation of the given number
    binary_n = bin(n)[2:]

    # Adding leading zeroes to make the length of binary_n even
    if len(binary_n) % 2 != 0:
        binary_n = '0' + binary_n

    # Replacing even position bits with 1
    new_binary_n = ''
    for i in range(0, len(binary_n), 2):
        new_binary_n += '1' + binary_n[i+1]

    # Converting binary string to integer
    result = int(new_binary_n, 2)

    # Returning the result
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 1431655767
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
