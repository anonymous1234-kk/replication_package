I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.
    '''

    # binary representation of the number
    binary_num = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # making the binary representation even length by adding a 0 at the beginning
    if len(binary_num) % 2 == 1:
        binary_num = '0' + binary_num
    
    # setting even bits to 1

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_bit_set_number(7) == 1431655767
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
