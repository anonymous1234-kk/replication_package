I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def bitwise_xor(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to perform the mathematical bitwise xor operation across the given tuples.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def bitwise_xor(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to perform the mathematical bitwise xor operation across the given tuples.
    '''

    # converting the tuples to sets
    set1 = set(test_tup1)
    set2 = set(test_tup2)

    # performing the bitwise xor operation between the two sets
    xor_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

    # converting the set to a tuple and returning it
    return tuple(xor_set)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert bitwise_xor((2, 3, 4),(4, 6, 5, 7, 8)) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
