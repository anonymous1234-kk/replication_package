You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''

    """
    Find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.

    Args:
    test_tup1 (tuple): A tuple containing elements of any data type.
    test_tup2 (tuple): A tuple containing elements of any data type.

    Returns:
    sorted_list (list): A sorted list containing the union of the elements from both tuples.
    """
    # Convert the input tuples into sets
    set1 = set(test_tup1)
    set2 = set(test_tup2)

    # Find the union of the two sets
    union_set = set1.union(set2)

    # Convert the union set back to a sorted list
    sorted_list = sorted(list(union_set))

    return sorted_list

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert union_elements((1, 2, 3),(4, 5, 6, 3, 2)) == (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
