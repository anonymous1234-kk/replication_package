I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def union_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    '''

    # Convert the tuples to sets and find their union
    union_set = set(test_tup1).union(set(test_tup2))
    
    # Convert the union set to a sorted list
    union_list = sorted(list(union_set))
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return union_list

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert union_elements((1, 2, 3),(4, 5, 6, 3, 2)) == (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
