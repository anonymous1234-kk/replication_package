You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Return the n most expensive items from the given dataset.
    
    :param items: A list of tuples, each containing the name and price of an item.
    :param n: The number of most expensive items to return.
    
    :return: A list of the n most expensive items from the given dataset.
    """
    # Use a heap to keep track of the n most expensive items
    # The heap is kept in a min-heap order so that we can easily
    # check if an item is more expensive than the current n-th item
    most_expensive = []
    for item in items:
        # We use the negative price as the heap key because Python's
        # heapq only provides a min-heap implementation
        price = -item[1]
        if len(most_expensive) < n:
            heapq.heappush(most_expensive, (price, item[0]))
        else:
            if price > most_expensive[0][0]:
                heapq.heappushpop(most_expensive, (price, item[0]))
    
    # Return the n most expensive items in the order they were added
    return [item[1] for item in sorted(most_expensive, reverse=True)]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
