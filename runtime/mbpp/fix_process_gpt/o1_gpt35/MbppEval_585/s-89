I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Finds the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    
    Args:
    items: A list of tuples representing items, where each tuple contains the name of the item
           and its price.
    n: An integer representing the number of most expensive items to find.
    
    Returns:
    A list of tuples representing the n most expensive items, where each tuple contains the name
    of the item and its price. The list is sorted in descending order of prices.
    """
    # Create a heap containing the items sorted by their prices in descending order
    max_heap = [(-price, name) for name, price in items]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    
    # Extract the top n items with the highest prices
    top_n_items = [(name, -price) for price, name in heapq.nsmallest(n, max_heap)]
    
    # Sort the items by their prices in descending order
    top_n_items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    return top_n_items

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
