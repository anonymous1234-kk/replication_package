I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.

    Parameters:
    items (list): A list of tuples representing items and their prices.
    n (int): The number of most expensive items to find.

    Returns:
    list: A list of the n most expensive items in the dataset.
    """
    # Use a min heap to keep track of the n most expensive items so far
    most_expensive = []
    for item in items:
        # Calculate the negative price to simulate a max heap
        price = item[1] * -1
        # Push the item onto the heap
        heapq.heappush(most_expensive, (price, item))
        # If the heap has more than n items, pop the smallest one
        if len(most_expensive) > n:
            heapq.heappop(most_expensive)
    # Return the n most expensive items
    return [item[1] for item in most_expensive][::-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    most_expensive = []
    for item in items:
        price = float(item[1]) * -1
        heapq.heappush(most_expensive, (price, item))
        if len(most_expensive) > n:
