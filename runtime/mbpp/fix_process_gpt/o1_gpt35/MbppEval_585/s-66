You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
    # Use a heap to find the n most expensive items
    # Convert the price of each item to a negative number so that the heap can maintain the smallest items
    heap = [(-price, item) for item, price in items.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    
    # Extract the n most expensive items from the heap
    expensive = [heapq.heappop(heap)[1] for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Return the list of n most expensive items
    return expensive

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

def expensive_items(items, n):
    heap = [(-float(price), item) for item, price in items]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    
    expensive = [heapq.heappop(heap)[1] for _ in range(n)]
    
    return expensive
