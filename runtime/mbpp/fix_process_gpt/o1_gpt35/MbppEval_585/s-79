You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.

    Parameters:
    items (list): A list of tuples containing item name and its corresponding price.
    n (int): The number of most expensive items to return.

    Returns:
    list: A list of tuples containing the n most expensive items in the dataset.
    """
    # Create a heap using the negative price of the items
    heap = [(-price, name) for name, price in items]
    # Use heapq to convert the list into a heap
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    # Return the n most expensive items as a list of tuples
    return [(name, -price) for price, name in heapq.nsmallest(n, heap)]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
