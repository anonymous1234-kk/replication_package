You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Find the n most expensive items in the given dataset.
    """
    # Use a heap to keep track of the n most expensive items
    heap = []
    for item in items:
        # Negate the price to get a max heap
        price = -item['price']
        heapq.heappush(heap, (price, item))
        if len(heap) > n:
            # Pop the cheapest item from the heap
            heapq.heappop(heap)

    # Return a list of the most expensive items
    return [item for price, item in heap]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items, n):
    heap = []
    for item in items:
        price = -float(item[1])  # Convert price to float
        heapq.heappush(heap, (price, item))
        if len(heap) > n:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    return [item for price, item in heap]
```
