I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''
```

```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    """
    # Use a heap to keep track of the most expensive items
    h = []
    
    # Iterate over each item in the dataset
    for item in items:
        # If the heap is not yet full, add the item to the heap
        if len(h) < n:
            heapq.heappush(h, item)
        else:
            # If the heap is full, check if the current item is more expensive than the smallest item in the heap
            if item[1] > h[0][1]:
                # If it is, remove the smallest item from the heap and add the current item
                heapq.heappop(h)
                heapq.heappush(h, item)
    
    # Return the n most expensive items in the heap
    return sorted(h, key=lambda x: -x[1])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert expensive_items([('item1', '12.20'), ('item2', '15.10'), ('item3', '24.5'), ('item4', '45.00'), ('item5', '9.50')],2) == [('item4', '45.00'), ('item3', '24.5')]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:
```python
import heapq
def expensive_items(items,n):
    '''
    Write a function to find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    '''

    """
    Find the n most expensive items in a given dataset.
    """
    # Use a heap to keep track of the most expensive items
    h = []
    
    # Iterate over each item in the dataset
    for item in items:
        # Convert the price to a float
        price = float(item[1])
        
        # If the heap is not yet full, add the item to the heap
        if len(h) < n:
            heapq.heappush(h, (item[0], price))
        else:
            # If the heap is full, check if the current item is more expensive than the smallest item in the heap
            if price > h[0][1]:
                # If it is, remove the smallest item from the heap and add the current item
                heapq.heappop(h)

    # Return the n most expensive items in the heap
    return sorted(h, key=lambda x: -x[1])
```
