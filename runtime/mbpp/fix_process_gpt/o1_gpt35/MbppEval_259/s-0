You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def maximize_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def maximize_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples.
    '''

    # Concatenating two tuples and getting its unique elements.
    result = set(test_tup1 + test_tup2)
    
    # Converting the set to tuple and returning the final result.
    return tuple(result)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert maximize_elements((1, 3, 5),(2, 5, 7, 8)) == (2, 5, 7, 8)
