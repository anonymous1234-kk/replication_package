I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def maximize_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def maximize_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    '''
    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to maximize the given two tuples.
    '''
    # Get the maximum elements from the two tuples
    max_val1 = max(test_tup1)
    max_val2 = max(test_tup2)
    
    # Create a new tuple with the maximum elements
    result_tup = (max_val1, max_val2)
    
    # Return the new tuple
    return result_tup

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert maximize_elements((1, 3, 5),(2, 5, 7, 8)) == (2, 5, 7, 8)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
