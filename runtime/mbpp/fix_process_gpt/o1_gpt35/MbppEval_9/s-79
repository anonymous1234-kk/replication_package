I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_Rotations(str): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_Rotations(str): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.
    '''
 
    n = len(s) 
    for i in range(1, n+1): 
        if (n % i == 0): 
            tmp = s[:i] 
            j = i 
            while(j < n and s[j:j+i] == tmp): 
                j += i 
            if (j == n): 
                return n // i
    return n

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_Rotations('abba') == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
