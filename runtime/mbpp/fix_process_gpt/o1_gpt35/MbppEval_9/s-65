I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_Rotations(str): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_Rotations(str): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.
    '''
 
    # Find length of given string 
    n = len(str) 
    # Create a copy of given string and append it to itself 
    str = str + str 
    # Initialize result as n 
    min_rotation = n 
    # One by one consider all substrings of size n 
    # and find minimum rotation  
    for i in range(n): 
        rotation = 0
        for j in range(n): 
            if str[i + j] != str[j]: 
                break
            rotation += 1
        # Update minimum rotation if it's less than current minimum 
        min_rotation = min(min_rotation, rotation) 
    return min_rotation 

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_Rotations('abba') == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
