You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
```

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
 
    # Base case - If n is 0, return False
    if n == 0:
        return False
    
    # Loop through all the powers of 2 less than or equal to n
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        # If i is equal to n, then n is a power of 2
        if i == n:
            return True
        
        # Subtract the current power of 2 from n and continue
        n -= i
        
        # Double the current power of 2
        i *= 2
    
    # If we haven't found a sum of powers of 2 that equals n, return False
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(31) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(11) == False
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(23) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
