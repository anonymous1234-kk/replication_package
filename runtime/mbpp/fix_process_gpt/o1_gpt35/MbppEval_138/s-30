I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
```

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
 
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return False
  
    # Check if n is a power of 2
    while (n % 2 == 0):
        n = n // 2
  
    # If n is already a power of 2
    if (n == 1):
        return True
  
    # Check for all other cases
    while (n > 1):
        # Find the greatest power of 2 less than n
        next_power = 2
        while (next_power <= n):
            next_power = next_power * 2
        next_power = next_power // 2
  
        # Update n and check again
        n = n - next_power
        if (n == 1):
            return True
  
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(11) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
