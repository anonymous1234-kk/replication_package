You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
```

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.
    '''
 
    # Check if the given number is less than 2
    if n < 2:
        return False
    
    # Find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n
    highest_power_of_two = 1
    while highest_power_of_two <= n:
        highest_power_of_two *= 2
    highest_power_of_two //= 2
    
    # Subtract the highest power of 2 from n and repeat the process
    while n > 0:
        n -= highest_power_of_two
        if n == 0:
            return True
        while highest_power_of_two > n:
            highest_power_of_two //= 2
            
    # If the loop ends without returning True, the number cannot be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2
    return False

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(11) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
