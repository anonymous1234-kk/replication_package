You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m,n): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.
    '''
```

    '''

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        if i >= 2 * get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n-1):
            break
        count += get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n-1)
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_total_number_of_sequences(4,4) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
