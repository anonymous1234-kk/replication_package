I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m,n): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.
    '''
```

    '''

    if m < 2 or n < 1:
        return 0
    
    # Create a 2D table to store the results of subproblems
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill the table for the base case
    for j in range(1, m + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 1
    
    # Fill the table for the general case
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            for k in range(j // 2, j):
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][k]
    
    # Return the sum of values in the last row of the table
    return sum(dp[-1])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_total_number_of_sequences(4,4) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
