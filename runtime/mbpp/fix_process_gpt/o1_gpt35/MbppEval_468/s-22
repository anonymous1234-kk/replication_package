I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
   
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize dp table
    dp = [0]*n
    # Fill the dp table from left to right
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize max product for ith element
        max_prod = 1
        # Find the maximum product by multiplying with elements of increasing subsequence to the left of i
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_prod = max(max_prod, dp[j]*arr[i])
        # Update the dp table with max product for ith element
        dp[i] = max_prod
    # Return the maximum value in dp table
    return max(dp)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
