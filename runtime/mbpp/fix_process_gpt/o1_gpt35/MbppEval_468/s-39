I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the dp array with 1
    dp = [1] * n
    # Fill the dp array from left to right
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            # If the current number is greater than the previous number
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                # Update the dp array with the maximum product so far
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * arr[i])
    # Return the maximum product in the dp array
    return max(dp)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
