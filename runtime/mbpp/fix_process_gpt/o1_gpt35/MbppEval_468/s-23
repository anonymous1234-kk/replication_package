I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize a list to store maximum product values
    max_product = [0] * n
    # Initialize a list to store the last index of each increasing subsequence
    last_index = [-1] * n
    # Initialize the first element of each list as the first element of the array
    max_product[0] = arr[0]
    last_index[0] = 0
    # Traverse the array to find the maximum product of each increasing subsequence
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_val = 0
        index = -1
        # Find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of increasing subsequence ending at index j
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i] and max_product[j] > max_val:
                max_val = max_product[j]
                index = j
        # If index is not -1, update the maximum product at index i
        if index != -1:
            max_product[i] = max_val * arr[i]
            last_index[i] = index
        else:
            max_product[i] = arr[i]

    # Find the index of the maximum value in the max_product list
    max_index = max(range(n), key=lambda i: max_product[i])
    # Initialize a list to store the increasing subsequence
    subsequence = []
    # Traverse the last_index list to find the increasing subsequence
    while max_index != -1:
        subsequence.append(arr[max_index])

    subsequence.reverse()
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, subsequence)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 9
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
