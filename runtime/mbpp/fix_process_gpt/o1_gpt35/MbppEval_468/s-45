I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the max product to be the first number
    max_prod = arr[0]
    
    # Initialize an array to store the maximum product for each subsequence ending at i
    max_prods = [arr[0]]
    
    # Loop through the array
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Initialize the maximum product for this subsequence
        cur_max_prod = 0
        
        # Loop through the sub-sequences ending at j<i
        for j in range(i):
            # If the sub-sequence is increasing and the product is greater than the current max, update the max
            if arr[j] < arr[i] and max_prods[j] > cur_max_prod:
                cur_max_prod = max_prods[j]
        
        # Update the max product for the subsequence ending at i
        max_prods.append(cur_max_prod + arr[i])

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([3, 2, 5, 10, 9, 12]) == 1800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_product([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 9
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
