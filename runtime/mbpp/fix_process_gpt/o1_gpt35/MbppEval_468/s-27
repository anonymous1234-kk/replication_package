I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
   
    # initialize variables to keep track of maximum product and the last element of the increasing subsequence
    max_prod = float('-inf')
    last_elem = float('-inf')
    
    # loop through the array
    for num in arr:
        # if the current number is greater than the last element, update the maximum product
        if num > last_elem:
            max_prod = max(max_prod, last_elem*num)
            last_elem = num
    
    # return the maximum product
    return max_prod

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 9
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
