I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize the variable to hold the maximum product
    max_product = float('-inf')

    # Iterate over all the possible starting indices of the subsequence
    for i in range(n):

        # Initialize the variable to hold the product of the current subsequence
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the remaining elements of the array to form a subsequence starting at index i
        for j in range(i, n):

            # If the current element is greater than the previous element in the subsequence, multiply it with the product
            if arr[j] > arr[i - 1]:
                product *= arr[j]

            # If the product of the subsequence is greater than the current maximum product, update the maximum product
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product

    # Return the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of the array
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
