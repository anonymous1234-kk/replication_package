I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize the dp table
    dp = [0] * n

    # Initialize the result variable
    res = 0

    # Loop through the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize the max value for subsequence ending at i
        max_val = 0

        # Loop through the elements before i
        for j in range(i):
            # If jth element is smaller than the ith element
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                # Update the max value
                max_val = max(max_val, dp[j])

        # Update the dp table for the ith element
        dp[i] = max_val + arr[i]

        # Update the result variable
        res = max(res, dp[i])

    # Return the result
    return res

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
