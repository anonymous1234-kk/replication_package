I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum product and the current product
    max_product = float("-inf")
    curr_product = 1

    # Loop through the array, keeping track of the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # If the current number is greater than or equal to the previous number, update the current product
        if i > 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i-1]:
            curr_product *= arr[i]
        # Otherwise, update the maximum product and reset the current product
        else:
            max_product = max(max_product, curr_product)
            curr_product = arr[i]
    
    # Update the maximum product one last time before returning it
    max_product = max(max_product, curr_product)
    
    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
