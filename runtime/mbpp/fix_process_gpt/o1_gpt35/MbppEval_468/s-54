I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the product variable to 1
    prod = 1
    # Initialize the max product variable to 1
    max_prod = 1
    # Loop through the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Initialize the current product variable to 1
        cur_prod = 1
        # Loop through the array from the current index to the end
        for j in range(i, n):
            # Check if the current number is larger than the previous number
            if arr[j] > arr[i]:
                # Multiply the current product with the current number
                cur_prod *= arr[j]
        # Check if the current product is greater than the max product
        if cur_prod > max_prod:
            # Update the max product variable
            max_prod = cur_prod
    # Return the max product
    return max_prod

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
