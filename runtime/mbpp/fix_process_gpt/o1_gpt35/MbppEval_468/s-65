You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return 0

    # Initialize variables to store the maximum product and the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    max_product = 0
    lis_length = [1] * n

    # Compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence at each index of the array
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                lis_length[i] = max(lis_length[i], lis_length[j] + 1)

    # Compute the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of the array
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, n):
            if lis_length[j] > lis_length[i] or (lis_length[j] == lis_length[i] and arr[j] > arr[i]):
                product *= arr[j]
        max_product = max(max_product, product)

    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

I apologize for the mistake. Here is the fixed code:

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return 0

    # Initialize variables to store the maximum product and the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    max_product = 1
    lis_length = [1] * n

    # Compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence at each index of the array
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                lis_length[i] = max(lis_length[i], lis_length[j] + 1)

    # Compute the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of the array
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, n):
            if lis_length[j] > lis_length[i] or (lis_length[j] == lis_length[i] and arr[j] > arr[i]):
                product *= arr[j]
        max_product = max(max_product, product)

    return max_product
```
