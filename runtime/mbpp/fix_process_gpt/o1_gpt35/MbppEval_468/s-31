I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Base Case:
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Initialize the maximum product variable:
    max_prod = arr[0]

    # Initialize the max positive and min negative product variables:
    max_pos = arr[0]
    min_neg = arr[0]

    # Traverse the array and update the variables:
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            max_pos = max(max_pos * arr[i], arr[i])
            min_neg = min(min_neg * arr[i], arr[i])
        else:
            temp = max_pos
            max_pos = max(min_neg * arr[i], arr[i])
            min_neg = min(temp * arr[i], arr[i])
        
        max_prod = max(max_prod, max_pos)

    return max_prod

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
