I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
   
    if not arr:
        return 0

    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = arr[0]

    for i in range(1, n):
        max_val = 0
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                max_val = max(max_val, dp[j])

        dp[i] = max_val + arr[i]

    return max(dp)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([3, 2, 5, 10, 9, 12]) == 1800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_product([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 9
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
