I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    # Create a list to store the maximum product that can be formed using each number in the array
    max_product_list = [arr[i] for i in range(n)]
    # Initialize the maximum product to be the first number in the array
    max_product = arr[0]
    # Iterate over each number in the array
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Iterate over all the numbers before i
        for j in range(i):
            # If arr[j] is less than arr[i] and the product of arr[j] and max_product_list[i] is greater than max_product_list[i],
            # update max_product_list[i] to be the product of arr[j] and max_product_list[i]
            if arr[j] < arr[i] and arr[j] * max_product_list[i] > max_product_list[i]:
                max_product_list[i] = arr[j] * max_product_list[j]
        # If max_product_list[i] is greater than max_product, update max_product to be max_product_list[i]
        if max_product_list[i] > max_product:
            max_product = max_product_list[i]
    # Return the maximum product
    return max_product

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([3, 2, 5, 10, 9, 12]) == 1800
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_product([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 9
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
