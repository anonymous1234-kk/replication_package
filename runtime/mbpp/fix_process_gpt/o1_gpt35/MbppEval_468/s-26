I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''
```

```python
def max_product(arr):   
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return 0

    max_product = float('-inf')
    max_end = 0
    min_end = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            max_end = max_end * arr[i] or arr[i]
            min_end *= arr[i]
        elif arr[i] == 0:
            max_end = 0
            min_end = 0
        else:
            tmp = max_end
            max_end = min_end * arr[i]
            min_end = tmp * arr[i] or arr[i]

        max_product = max(max_product, max_end)

    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product([10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]) == 1742400000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
