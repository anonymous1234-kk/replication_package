I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)],[(3, 4), (2, 1)]) == [(1, 2)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
