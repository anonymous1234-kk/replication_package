You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    # Convert the lists into sets to perform set intersection
    set1 = set(test_list1)
    set2 = set(test_list2)

    # Perform set intersection to get common elements
    intersection = set1 & set2

    # Convert the common elements set into list of tuples
    result = [tuple([elem]) for elem in intersection]
