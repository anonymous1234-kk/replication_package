You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    # Convert the input lists to sets
    set1 = set(test_list1)
    set2 = set(test_list2)
    
    # Find the intersection of the two sets
    intersection_set = set1 & set2
    
    # Convert the intersection set back to a list of tuples
    intersection_list = [tuple(sorted(item)) for item in intersection_set]
    
    # Sort the intersection list and return it
    return sorted(intersection_list)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(2, 4, 5), (5, 7, 8), (8, 10, 9)],[(4, 2, 5), (7, 5, 8)]) == [(2, 4, 5), (5, 7, 8)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
