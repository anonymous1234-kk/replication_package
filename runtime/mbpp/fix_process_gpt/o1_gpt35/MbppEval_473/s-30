You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    # Convert the tuple lists to sets
    set1 = set(test_list1)
    set2 = set(test_list2)

    # Find the common elements between the sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)

    # Create a list of tuples by pairing up the common elements
    result = [(elem1, elem2) for elem1 in common_elements for elem2 in common_elements if elem1 != elem2]

    return result

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(2, 4, 5), (5, 7, 8), (8, 10, 9)],[(4, 2, 5), (7, 5, 8), (8, 10)]) == [(2, 4, 5), (5, 7, 8)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
