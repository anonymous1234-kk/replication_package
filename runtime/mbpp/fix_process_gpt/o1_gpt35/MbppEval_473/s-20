You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------User Message----------------------
The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)],[(3, 2, 1), (6, 5, 4)]) == [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    def sort_tuple(t):
        # helper function to sort the elements in a tuple
        return tuple(sorted(t))

    # sort the tuples in the input lists
    sorted_list1 = [sort_tuple(t) for t in test_list1]
    sorted_list2 = [sort_tuple(t) for t in test_list2]

    # convert lists to sets to eliminate duplicates and perform set intersection
    set1 = set(sorted_list1)
    set2 = set(sorted_list2)

    # find the intersection of the sets
    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)

    # sort the tuples in the intersection
    sorted_intersection = [sort_tuple(t) for t in intersection]

    # return the sorted intersection as a list of tuples
    return sorted_intersection
```
