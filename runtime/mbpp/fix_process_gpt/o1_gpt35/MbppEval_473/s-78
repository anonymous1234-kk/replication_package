I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
    # Convert the input lists to sets of tuples to remove any duplicates.
    set1 = set([tuple(sorted(item)) for item in test_list1])
    set2 = set([tuple(sorted(item)) for item in test_list2])

    # Compute the intersection of the two sets.
    intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)

    # Convert the intersection set back to a list of tuples and return it.
    return [tuple(item) for item in intersection_set]

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([0, 1, 2, 3, 4],[2, 3, 4]) == (2, 3, 4)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
