You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    # Convert the tuples to sets and find intersection
    set1 = set(test_list1)
    set2 = set(test_list2)
    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert the intersection set back to a tuple
    intersection_tuple = tuple(intersection)
    
    return intersection_tuple

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9, 10)],[(3, 2, 1), (6, 5, 4), (1, 2, 3)]) == [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
