You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    # create sets from the given lists
    set1 = set(test_list1)
    set2 = set(test_list2)

    # find the intersection of the two sets
    intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)

    # convert the set to a list and return
    return list(intersection_set)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tuple_intersection([(1, 2), (4, 5), (3, 6)],[(3, 4), (2, 1)]) == [(1, 2)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
