You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    """
    Find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.

    test_list1(list): A list of tuples.
    test_list2(list): A list of tuples.

    Returns:
    result(list): A list of tuples containing the intersection elements.

    Example:
    >>> tuple_intersection([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)], [(3, 4), (1, 2)])
