You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.

```python
def tuple_intersection(test_list1, test_list2):
    '''
    Write a function to find the tuple intersection of elements in the given tuple list irrespective of their order.
    '''

    set1 = set(test_list1)
    set2 = set(test_list2)
    
    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    return list(intersection)
```

Note that I removed the `tuple(sorted(...))` part from the return statement. This is because the `intersection` set will already contain tuples, and sorting them is not necessary.
