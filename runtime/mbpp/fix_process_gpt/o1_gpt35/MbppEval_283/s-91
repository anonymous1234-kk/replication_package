You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def validate(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
    '''
```

    '''
    # Convert the integer into string to get its digits
    digits = str(n)
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each digit
    freq = {}
    
    # Iterate over each digit and update its frequency in the dictionary
    for d in digits:
        freq[d] = freq.get(d, 0) + 1
    
    # Iterate over each digit and check if its frequency is less than or equal to the digit itself
    for d in digits:
        if freq[d] > int(d):
            return False
    return True

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert validate(-234) == True
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert validate(111222333444555666777888999000) == False
assert validate(1233334) == False
assert validate(1112333) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
