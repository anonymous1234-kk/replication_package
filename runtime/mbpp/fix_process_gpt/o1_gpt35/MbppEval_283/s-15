You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def validate(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
    '''
```

```python
def validate(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
    '''
 
    # Convert the integer into a string and get the length
    n_str = str(n)
    n_len = len(n_str)
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each digit
    freq = {}
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i in range(n_len):
        # Get the current digit
        digit = n_str[i]
        
        # If the digit is not in the dictionary, add it with a frequency of 1
        if digit not in freq:
            freq[digit] = 1
        # If the digit is already in the dictionary, increment its frequency by 1
        else:
            freq[digit] += 1
    
    # Iterate through the dictionary and check whether the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself
    for digit, frequency in freq.items():
        if int(digit) < frequency:
            return False
    
    # If all digits have a frequency less than or equal to the digit itself, return True
    return True

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert validate(-234) == True
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert validate(111222333444555666777888999000) == False
assert validate(1233334) == False
assert validate(1112333) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
