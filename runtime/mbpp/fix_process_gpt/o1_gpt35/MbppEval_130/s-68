You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_occurrences(nums):
    '''
    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.
    '''
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
def max_occurrences(nums):
    '''
    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the item with maximum frequency in a given list.
    '''
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency count of each item
    frequency = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        frequency[num] += 1

    # Find the item(s) with the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(frequency.values())
    max_items = [k for k, v in frequency.items() if v == max_freq]

    # Return the item(s) with the maximum frequency
    return max_items

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_occurrences([3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
