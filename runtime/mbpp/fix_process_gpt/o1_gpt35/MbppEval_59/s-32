You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def is_octagonal(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth octagonal number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def is_octagonal(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth octagonal number.
    '''

    """
    This function takes an integer n as input and returns True if n is an octagonal number,
    False otherwise. An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon.
    It is defined as P(n) = n*(3*n-2), for n >= 1.
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    # The nth octagonal number is given by P(n) = n*(3*n-2)
    octagonal_num = n*(3*n-2)
    # Check if the octagonal number is equal to the input value n
    return octagonal_num == n

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_octagonal(6) == 96
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
