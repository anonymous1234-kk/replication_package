You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def frequency_lists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary.
    '''
```

```python
def frequency_lists(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary.
    '''
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element
    freq_dict = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Flatten the list of lists
    flat_list = [item for sublist in list1 for item in sublist]
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each element in the flattened list
    for item in flat_list:
        freq_dict[item] += 1
    
    # Return the frequency dictionary
    return freq_dict

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert frequency_lists([[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]]) == {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def frequency_lists(list1):
    freq_dict = defaultdict(int)
    flat_list = [item for sublist in list1 for item in sublist]
    for item in flat_list:
        freq_dict[item] += 1
    return freq_dict
```
