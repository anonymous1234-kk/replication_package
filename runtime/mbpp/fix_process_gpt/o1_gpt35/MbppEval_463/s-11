You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_subarray_product(arr):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product subarray of the given array.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_subarray_product(arr):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum product subarray of the given array.
    '''

    """
    Write a function to find the maximum product subarray of the given array.
    """
    # Initialize variables to hold the maximum product and current product
    max_product = arr[0]
    current_product = arr[0]

    # Loop through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Calculate the current product
        current_product *= arr[i]

        # Update the maximum product if the current product is greater
        if current_product > max_product:
            max_product = current_product

        # Reset the current product if it becomes 0
        if current_product == 0:
            current_product = 1

    return max_product

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_subarray_product([-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) == 5040
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_subarray_product([3, 4, -1, 5, 6, 7, -8, 2]) == 40320
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
