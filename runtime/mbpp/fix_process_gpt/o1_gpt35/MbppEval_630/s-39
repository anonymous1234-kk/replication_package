You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''

    # Define the list of adjacent coordinates
    adjacents = []
    
    # Extract the row and column values of the given element
    row, col = ele[0], ele[1]
    
    # Add the adjacent coordinates to the list
    adjacents.append((row-1, col))
    adjacents.append((row, col-1))
    adjacents.append((row+1, col))
    adjacents.append((row, col+1))
    
    # Filter out the coordinates that are out of bounds

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert adjac((2, 3),[(3, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7)]) == [(3, 4)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
