You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''

    i, j = ele
    adjacents = []
    for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
        if (x, y) not in sub:
            adjacents.append((x, y))
    return adjacents

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert adjac((2, 2),[(2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3)]) == [(3, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''

    i, j = ele
    adjacents = []
    for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
        if (x, y) not in sub and 0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]):
            adjacents.append((x, y))
    return adjacents

```

Please note that I added the condition `0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0])` to ensure that the adjacent coordinates are within the boundaries of the grid.
