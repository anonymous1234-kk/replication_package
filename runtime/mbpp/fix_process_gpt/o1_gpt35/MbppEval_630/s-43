You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''
 
    adjacents = []
    x, y = ele
    for i in range(x-1, x+2):
        for j in range(y-1, y+2):
            if (i,j) != ele:
                adjacents.append((i,j))
    return adjacents

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert adjac((0, 1),[(0, 0), (1, 1)]) == [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
