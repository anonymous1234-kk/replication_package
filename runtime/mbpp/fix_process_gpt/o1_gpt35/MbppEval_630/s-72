You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''

    x, y = ele
    adj = [(x-1,y), (x,y-1), (x,y+1), (x+1,y)]
    adj = [a for a in adj if a[0]>=0 and a[1]>=0]
    if sub:
        adj = [a for a in adj if a not in sub]
    return adj

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert adjac((2, 2),[(2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3)]) == [(3, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
