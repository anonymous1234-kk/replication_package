I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
    '''
    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''
```

    Write a function to extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.
    '''

    # Get the row and column values of the given coordinate
    r, c = ele
    
    # Define a list to store the adjacent coordinates
    adjacents = []
    
    # Loop through all adjacent coordinates and append them to the list

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert adjac((2, 2),[(2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3)]) == [(3, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)]
