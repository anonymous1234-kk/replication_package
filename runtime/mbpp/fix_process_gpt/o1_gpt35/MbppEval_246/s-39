You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initial guess for the square root
    x = number / 2
    
    # Loop until convergence
    while True:
        # Calculate the next guess
        y = (x + number/x) / 2
        
        # Check if the guess has converged
        if abs(y - x) < 0.00001:
            return y
        
        # Update the guess
        x = y

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(2) == 1.414213562373095
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
