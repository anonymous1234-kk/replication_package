You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initial estimate of the square root
    estimate = number / 2.0

    # Loop until we reach a desired level of accuracy
    while True:
        # Calculate the new estimate
        new_estimate = (estimate + number / estimate) / 2.0

        # Check if the new estimate is accurate enough
        if abs(new_estimate - estimate) < 0.0001:
            return new_estimate

        # Update the estimate for the next iteration
        estimate = new_estimate

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(3) == 1.7320508075688772
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
