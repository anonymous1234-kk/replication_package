You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def babylonian_squareroot(number):
    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function for computing square roots using the babylonian method.
    '''
    # Initial guess
    guess = number / 2.0

    # Iterate until convergence
    while True:
        # Calculate new guess
        new_guess = 0.5 * (guess + number / guess)

        # Check for convergence
        if abs(new_guess - guess) < 0.000001:
            break

        # Update guess
        guess = new_guess

    return new_guess

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert babylonian_squareroot(37) == 6.082207001484488
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
