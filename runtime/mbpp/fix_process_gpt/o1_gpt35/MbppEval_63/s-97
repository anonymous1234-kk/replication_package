You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''
    # Initialize the maximum difference to be the difference between the first two elements
    max_diff = abs(test_list[0][0] - test_list[0][1])
    
    # Iterate through all the tuples in the list
    for i in range(len(test_list)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(test_list)):
            # Calculate the absolute difference between the two elements in the tuple
            diff = abs(test_list[i][0] - test_list[j][1])
            # Update the maximum difference if the current difference is greater
            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
                
    # Return the maximum difference
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_difference([1, 2, 90, 10]) == 89
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    max_diff = 0
    
    for i in range(len(test_list)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(test_list)):
            diff = abs(test_list[i] - test_list[j])
            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
                
    return max_diff

```
