You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_difference(test_list):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    '''

    # Sort the given list in ascending order
    test_list.sort()

    # Find the difference between the last and first elements
    max_diff = test_list[-1] - test_list[0]

    return max_diff

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_difference([(1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)]) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert max_difference([1, 2, 90, 10]) == 89
```
.
