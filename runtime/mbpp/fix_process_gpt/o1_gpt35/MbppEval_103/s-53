You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''

    if m >= n or n < 0 or m < 0:
        return 0
    if m == 0:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        a, b = b, (m + 1) * a - m * b
    return a
```

This implementation uses the recurrence relation for Eulerian numbers:

```
a(n, m) = (m+1) * a(n-1, m) - m * a(n-2, m)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(2,2) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
