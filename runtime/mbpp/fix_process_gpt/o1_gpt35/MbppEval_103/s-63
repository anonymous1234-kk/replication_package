You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
 
    if m >= n or n < 0 or m < 0:
        return 0

    a0 = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        ai = 0
        j = 0
        k = i - m - 1
        while k >= 0:
            ai += (-1)**j * comb(i, j) * (i-j-1)**k
            j += 1
            k -= m + 1
        a0 = ai
    return a0
```

Note: This implementation requires the `comb` function from the `scipy.misc` module to calculate combinations. You can import the `comb` function by adding the following statement at the top of your Python file:

```python
from scipy.misc import comb

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(2,2) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
