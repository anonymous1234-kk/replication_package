You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
 
    # Initializing the Eulerian number as 0 
    E = 0 
    # Base Case 
    if (n == 0): 
        return 1 
    # Recursive definition of Eulerian number 
    if (m >= n or m == 0): 
        for k in range(n): 
            E += (-1)**k * binomial(n+1,k) * (m-k)**n 
    # Returning the Eulerian number 
    return E

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(2,2) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
