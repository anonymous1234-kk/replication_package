I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''

    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
