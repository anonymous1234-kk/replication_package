You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
    if m >= n or n == 0:
        return 0
    if m == 0:
        return 1
    prev = 1
    curr = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i <= m:
            curr = i + 1
        else:
            curr = prev + (i-m)*curr
            prev = curr
    return curr
```

The function takes two arguments `n` and `m` and returns the Eulerian number `a(n, m)` using the following recurrence relation:

```
a(n, m) = 0                      if m >= n or n == 0
a(n, 0) = 1
a(n, m) = (n-m)*a(n-1, m-1) + (m+1)*a(n-1, m)    if m > 0 and m < n

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(2,2) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
