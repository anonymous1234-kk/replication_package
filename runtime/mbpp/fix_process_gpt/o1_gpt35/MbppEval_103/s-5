You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):

    if m < 0 or n < m:
        return 0
    if m == 0:

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(4,2) == 11

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(4,2) == 11
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
