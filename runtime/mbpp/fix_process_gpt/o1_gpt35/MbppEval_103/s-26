You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''

    if m > n or n < 0 or m < 0:
        return 0
    elif m == 0 and n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m)
```

This implementation uses recursion to compute the Eulerian number `a(n, m)`. The base cases are when `n == m == 0` (in which case `a(n, m) == 1`) or when `m > n` or either `m` or `n` are negative (in which case `a(n, m) == 0`). For other values of `n` and `m`, we use the recurrence relation:

```
a(n, m) = (n - m) * a(n - 1, m - 1) + (m + 1) * a(n - 1, m)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(2,2) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
