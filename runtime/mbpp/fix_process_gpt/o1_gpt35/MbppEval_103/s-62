Certainly! Here is the fixed code:

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    eul = [[0 for i in range(m + 1)] for j in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        eul[1][i] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            eul[i][j] = (j + 1) * eul[i - 1][j] + (i - j) * eul[i - 1][j - 1]
    return eul[n][m]
```

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
