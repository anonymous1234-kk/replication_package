I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif m == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) - n * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(5,4) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
