You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def eulerian_num(n, m): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).
    '''

    # Initialize a matrix of size (n+1) x (m+1) with all zeros
    eulerian = [[0 for j in range(m+1)] for i in range(n+1)]
    
    # Initialize the first row of the matrix with alternating 1s and 0s
    for j in range(m+1):
        eulerian[0][j] = 1 if j % 2 == 0 else 0
    
    # Loop through the rows and columns of the matrix and compute the Eulerian numbers
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, m+1):
            eulerian[i][j] = (j+1) * eulerian[i-1][j] + (i-j) * eulerian[i-1][j-1]
    
    # Return the Eulerian number a(n, m)
    return eulerian[n][m]

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert eulerian_num(2,2) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
