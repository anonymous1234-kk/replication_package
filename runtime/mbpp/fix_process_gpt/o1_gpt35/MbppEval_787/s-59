I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by three 'b'.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def text_match_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by three 'b'.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by three 'b'.
    '''
    pattern = r"ab{3}"  # Define the regex pattern to match 'abbb'
    match_obj = re.search(pattern, text)  # Find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text
    if match_obj:
        return True  # Return True if the pattern is found in the text
    else:
        return False  # Return False if the pattern is not found in the text

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_three('aabb') == Not matched!
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
