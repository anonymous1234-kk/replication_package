I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''

    # Initialize the count of swaps
    count = 0
    
    # Traverse through the strings to find the number of differences
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            count += 1
    
    # Return the number of swaps required
    return (count // 2)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('111','010') == -1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert min_Swaps('1101010','0011101') == 3
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
