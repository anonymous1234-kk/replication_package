You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''

    # Count number of 0s and 1s in both strings
    count1 = count0 = count = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            count += 1
            if str1[i] == "1":
                count1 += 1
            else:
                count0 += 1

    # If counts of 0s or 1s in str1 is not equal to counts of 0s or 1s in str2, return -1
    if count1 != count0:
        return -1

    # Count number of swaps required
    res = 0
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):
        if str1[i] != str2[j]:
            res += 1
            i += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    return res

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('1101010','0011101') == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
