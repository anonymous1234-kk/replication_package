I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    '''
    Write a python function to count minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary number represented as a string to another.
    '''

    # Count number of zeroes and ones in both strings
    count_0_str1 = count_1_str1 = count_0_str2 = count_1_str2 = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] == '0':
            count_0_str1 += 1
        else:
            count_1_str1 += 1
        if str2[i] == '0':
            count_0_str2 += 1
        else:
            count_1_str2 += 1
    
    # If the number of zeroes or ones are not equal in both strings, they can't be converted with swaps
    if count_0_str1 != count_0_str2 or count_1_str1 != count_1_str2:
        return -1
    
    # Count the number of swaps required to convert str1 to str2
    swaps = 0
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(str1) and j < len(str2):
        if str1[i] != str2[j]:
            swaps += 1
        i += 1
        j += 1
    
    return swaps//2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Swaps('0000','1111') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert min_Swaps('1101010','0011101') == 3
assert min_Swaps('110011','001111') == 2
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
