You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def tetrahedral_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth tetrahedral number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def tetrahedral_number(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the nth tetrahedral number.
    '''
 
    return (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) // 6
``` 

This function computes the nth tetrahedral number, where n is the input argument. A tetrahedral number is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides. The nth tetrahedral number is defined as the sum of the first n triangular numbers, and can be computed using the formula: 

```
Tn = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tetrahedral_number(1) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
