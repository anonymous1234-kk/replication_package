I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
    # Initialize Perrin sequence with first three terms
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]
    
    # Calculate the remaining Perrin numbers
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        perrin.append(perrin[i - 2] + perrin[i - 3])
    
    # Calculate and return the sum of the first n Perrin numbers
    return sum(perrin[:n])

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert cal_sum(5) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
