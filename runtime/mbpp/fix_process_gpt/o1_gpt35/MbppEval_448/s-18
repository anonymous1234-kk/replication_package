I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
    if n < 3: # base case: when n is 0, 1, or 2, return n
        return n
    else:
        p = [3, 0, 2] # initialize the first three Perrin numbers
        for i in range(3, n+1): # calculate the next n-2 Perrin numbers
            next_p = p[i-2] + p[i-3]
            p.append(next_p)
        return sum(p) # return the sum of all n Perrin numbers

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert cal_sum(10) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
