You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
    # Define a list to store the Perrin numbers
    perrin = [3, 0, 2]

    # If n is less than or equal to 2, return the nth element of the perrin list
    if n <= 2:
        return perrin[n]

    # Otherwise, loop through the range of 3 to n+1 and calculate the nth Perrin number
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        perrin_n = perrin[i-2] + perrin[i-3]
        perrin.append(perrin_n)

    # Return the sum of the first n Perrin numbers
    return sum(perrin[:n])
```

Note that the Perrin sequence is defined as:

```
P(0) = 3
P(1) = 0
P(2) = 2
P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) for n >= 3

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert cal_sum(5) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
