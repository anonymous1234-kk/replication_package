You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''

    if n < 3: # if n is less than 3, return 0
        return 0
    perrin_numbers = [3, 0, 2] # initialize the first three perrin numbers
    total_sum = 5 # initialize the total sum to 5
    for i in range(3, n): # iterate from 3 up to n
        next_perrin_number = perrin_numbers[-2] + perrin_numbers[-3] # calculate the next perrin number
        perrin_numbers.append(next_perrin_number) # add the next perrin number to the list of perrin numbers
        total_sum += next_perrin_number # add the next perrin number to the total sum
    return total_sum # return the total sum of the perrin numbers

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert cal_sum(5) == 15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
