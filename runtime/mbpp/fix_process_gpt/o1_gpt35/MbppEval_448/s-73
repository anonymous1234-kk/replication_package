I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
```

```python
def cal_sum(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to calculate the sum of perrin numbers.
    '''
    if n < 3:
        return 0
    perrin_list = [3, 0, 2]
    total_sum = 5
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        curr_num = perrin_list[i-2] + perrin_list[i-3]
        perrin_list.append(curr_num)
        total_sum += curr_num
    return total_sum

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert cal_sum(10) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
