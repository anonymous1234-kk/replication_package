You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
    '''
```

```python
import math  
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum( n): 
    '''
    Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
    '''

    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the indices of the binomial coefficients up to n
    for i in range(n+1):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient using the math library
        coeff = math.comb(n,i)
        
        # Check if the index i is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Add the even index binomial coefficient to the sum
            sum += coeff
    
    # Return the sum of even index binomial coefficients
    return sum
```

Please note that the code block above should be exactly the same as the one below. If there are any differences, it is due to formatting.
```python
import math

def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the indices of the binomial coefficients up to n
    for i in range(n+1):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient using the math library
        coeff = math.comb(n,i)
        
        # Check if the index i is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Add the even index binomial coefficient to the sum
            sum += coeff
    
    # Return the sum of even index binomial coefficients
    return sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(5) == 16
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    return sum
