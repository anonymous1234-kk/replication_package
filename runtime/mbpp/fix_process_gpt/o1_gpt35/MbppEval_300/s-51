I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

    if n == 0: # If n = 0, there is only 1 possible sequence (empty sequence)

        for i in range(2**(2*n)): # Iterate over all possible binary sequences of length 2n
            seq = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n) # Convert i to binary and pad with zeros to make it 2n bits long
            first_half = seq[:n] # First n bits of the sequence
            second_half = seq[n:] # Last n bits of the sequence
            if sum(map(int, first_half)) == sum(map(int, second_half)): # If sum of first n bits is equal to sum of last n bits
                count += 1 # Increment count
        return count # Return the count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
