You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

    def count_seq_helper(l, r):

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Certainly! Here's the fixed code:

```python

    def count_seq_helper(l, r):
        if l == 0 and r == 0:
            return 1
        if l < r:

        res = 0
        if l > 0:
            res += count_seq_helper(l - 1, r)
        if r > 0:
            res += count_seq_helper(l, r - 1)
        if l == r:
            res *= 2
        return res

    return count_seq_helper(n, n)
