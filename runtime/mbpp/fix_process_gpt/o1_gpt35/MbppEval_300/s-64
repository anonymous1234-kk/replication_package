I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0

    # Loop over all possible binary sequences of length 2n
    for i in range(2**(2*n)):
        # Convert the integer i to a binary string of length 2n
        binary_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)

        # Get the first n bits and the last n bits
        first_n = binary_str[:n]
        last_n = binary_str[n:]

        # Check if the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits
        if sum([int(bit) for bit in first_n]) == sum([int(bit) for bit in last_n]):
            # If so, increment the count
            count += 1

    # Return the count
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
