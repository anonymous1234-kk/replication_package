You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Calculate the number of sequences
    count = 0

    # Iterate through all possible bit sequences of length 2n
    for i in range(2**(2*n)):
        # Convert the integer to a binary string of length 2n
        bin_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)

        # Count the number of ones in the first n bits and last n bits
        first_n = bin_str[:n].count('1')
        last_n = bin_str[n:].count('1')

        # If the counts are equal, increment the count
        if first_n == last_n:
            count += 1

    # Return the total count of sequences
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
