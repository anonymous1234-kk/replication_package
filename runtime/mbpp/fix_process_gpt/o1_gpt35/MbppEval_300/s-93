I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, there is only one valid binary sequence
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: count the number of valid sequences by summing the counts of two subproblems
    else:
        count = 0
        for i in range(2**(2*n - 1)):
            # Convert i to binary and pad with leading zeros as necessary
            binary_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n - 1)
            # Split the binary string into two halves of length n
            first_half = binary_str[:n]
            second_half = binary_str[n:]
            # Count the number of 1's in each half and compare the counts
            if first_half.count('1') == second_half.count('1'):
                count += 1

        return count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
