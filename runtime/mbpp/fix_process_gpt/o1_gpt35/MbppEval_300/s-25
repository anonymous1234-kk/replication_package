I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # initializing count as 0
    count = 0

    # calculating the total number of binary sequences of length 2n
    total = pow(2, 2*n)

    # iterating through all possible binary sequences
    for i in range(total):
        # converting the binary number into a string and padding it with zeroes to make it of length 2n
        binary = format(i, f'0{2*n}b')

        # slicing the first and last n bits of the binary number string

        sum_last_n_bits = sum([int(bit) for bit in last_n_bits])

        # checking if the sum of first n bits is same as the sum of last n bits
        if sum_first_n_bits == sum_last_n_bits:
            count += 1

    # returning the count of binary sequences
    return count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
