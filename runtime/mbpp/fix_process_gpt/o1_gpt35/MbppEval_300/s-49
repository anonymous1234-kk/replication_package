I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''
```

```python
def count_binary_seq(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
    '''

    # Initialize the count of valid sequences to 0.
    count = 0

    # Iterate over all possible binary sequences of length 2n.
    for i in range(2 ** (2 * n)):
        # Convert the integer i to a binary string with 2n digits.
        binary_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2 * n)

        # Compute the sum of the first n bits and last n bits.
        sum_first_half = sum(int(digit) for digit in binary_str[:n])
        sum_last_half = sum(int(digit) for digit in binary_str[n:])

        # If the sum of the first n bits equals the sum of the last n bits, increment the count of valid sequences.
        if sum_first_half == sum_last_half:
            count += 1

    # Return the count of valid sequences.
    return count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_binary_seq(12) == 2704156
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
