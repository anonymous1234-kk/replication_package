I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''

    return [tuple(i[:len(i)-K]) for i in test_list]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert trim_tuple([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)],2) == [(3,), (6,), (9,)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
