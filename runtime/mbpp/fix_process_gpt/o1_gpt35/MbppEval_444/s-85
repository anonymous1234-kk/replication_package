I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def trim_tuple(test_list, K):
    '''
    Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.
    '''

    result = []
    for tup in test_list:
        result.append(tuple(i-K for i in tup))
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert trim_tuple([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)],2) == [(3,), (6,), (9,)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
