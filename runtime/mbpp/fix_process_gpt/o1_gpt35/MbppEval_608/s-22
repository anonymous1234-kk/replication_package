I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def bell_Number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find nth bell number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def bell_Number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find nth bell number.
    '''

    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
    return bell[n][0]
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Bell number. The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that count how many ways a set of n elements can be partitioned into non-empty subsets. The first few Bell numbers are:

```
B0 = 1
B1 = 1
B2 = 2
B3 = 5
B4 = 15
B5 = 52
...
```

The implementation uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the Bell numbers. It creates a 2D array `bell` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` and initializes the first element to `1`. Then it iterates over the rows and columns of the array, computing the values of the Bell numbers using the recurrence relation:

```
bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert bell_Number(8) == 4140
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
