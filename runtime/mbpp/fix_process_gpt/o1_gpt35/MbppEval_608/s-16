I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def bell_Number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find nth bell number.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def bell_Number(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find nth bell number.
    '''
 
    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
    return bell[n][0]
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Bell number. The Bell numbers, named after Eric Temple Bell, are a sequence of numbers that appear in many areas of mathematics. The first few Bell numbers are:

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, 678570, 4213597, 27644437, 190899322, 1382958545, 10480142147, 82864869804, 682076806159, 5832742205057, ...
```

The Bell number `B(n)` is defined as the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements into non-empty subsets. For example, `B(3) = 5` because we can partition the set `{1, 2, 3}` into the following subsets:

```
{1}, {2}, {3}
{1}, {2, 3}
{1, 2}, {3}
{1, 3}, {2}
{1, 2, 3}

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert bell_Number(8) == 4140
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
