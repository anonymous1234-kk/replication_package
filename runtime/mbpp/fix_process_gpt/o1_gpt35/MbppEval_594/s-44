I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even = None
    odd = None
    
    # iterate through the list until both even and odd numbers are found
    for num in list1:
        if num % 2 == 0 and even is None:
            even = num
        elif num % 2 != 0 and odd is None:
            odd = num
        if even is not None and odd is not None:
            break
    
    # return the difference between the even and odd numbers
    return abs(even - odd)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert diff_even_odd([2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == -1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == 3
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
