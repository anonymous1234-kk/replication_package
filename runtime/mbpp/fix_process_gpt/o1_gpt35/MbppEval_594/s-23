You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even = None
    odd = None
    for i in list1:
        if i%2 == 0 and even is None:
            even = i
        elif i%2 != 0 and odd is None:
            odd = i
        if even is not None and odd is not None:
            break
    if even is None or odd is None:
        return 0
    return abs(even - odd)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert diff_even_odd([2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == -1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert diff_even_odd([1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == 3
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code that will pass all the provided test cases:

```python
def diff_even_odd(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the difference of the first even and first odd number of a given list.
    '''

    even = None
    odd = None
    for i in list1:
        if i%2 == 0 and even is None:
            even = i
        elif i%2 != 0 and odd is None:
            odd = i
        if even is not None and odd is not None:
            break
    if even is None or odd is None:
        return 0
    return even - odd
```

Please note that the difference is calculated as `even - odd` instead of `abs(even - odd)` in order to pass the test case `diff_even_odd([2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10]) == -1`.
