You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''

    # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers
    diff = abs(n1 - n2)
    
    # Convert the difference to a string to iterate over its digits
    diff_str = str(diff)
    
    # Initialize a variable to store the total distance
    distance = 0
    
    # Iterate over each digit in the difference string
    for digit in diff_str:
        # Add the integer value of the digit to the distance variable
        distance += int(digit)
    
    # Return the distance
    return distance

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(2000,489) == 23
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(234,489) == 12
assert digit_distance_nums(200,489) == 19
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
