I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''
```

```python
def digit_distance_nums(n1, n2):
    '''
    Write a python function to find the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers.
    '''

    # convert integers to strings to make it easy to iterate over their digits
    n1_str = str(n1)
    n2_str = str(n2)
    
    # initialize a variable to store the sum of the differences
    sum_of_differences = 0
    
    # iterate over the digits of the two integers using a loop
    for i in range(len(n1_str)):
        # calculate the absolute difference between the digits at the same position
        difference = abs(int(n1_str[i]) - int(n2_str[i]))
        # add the difference to the sum of differences
        sum_of_differences += difference
    
    # return the sum of differences
    return sum_of_differences

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(2000,489) == 23
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert digit_distance_nums(234,489) == 12
assert digit_distance_nums(200,489) == 19
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
