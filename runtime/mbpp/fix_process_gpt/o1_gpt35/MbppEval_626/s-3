I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

    '''
    Find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
    import math
    # Calculate the base of the largest triangle using Pythagoras theorem
    base = math.sqrt((2 * r) ** 2 - r ** 2)
    
    # Calculate the height of the largest triangle using trigonometry
    height = r
    
    # Calculate the area of the largest triangle
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    
    return area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(7) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
