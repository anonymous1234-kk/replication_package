The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(12) == 144.0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
