You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(6) == 36
