You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''

    return (r ** 2) * math.pi / 2
```

Explanation:
The area of a triangle is given by the formula `A = 1/2 * base * height`. In this case, the base of the triangle is the diameter of the semicircle (which is equal to 2 * radius) and the height of the triangle is the radius of the semicircle. Therefore, the area of the triangle is:

```
A = 1/2 * diameter * radius / 2
  = 1/4 * (2 * radius) * radius
  = (r ** 2) * pi / 2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(11) == 121
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
