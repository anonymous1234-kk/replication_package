You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

    '''

    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
    return r**2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(0.1) == 0.01
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
import math

def triangle_area(r) :  
    return (r**2)/2

assert triangle_area(0.1) == 0.01
```
