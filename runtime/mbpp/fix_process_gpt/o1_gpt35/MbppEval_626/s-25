You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def triangle_area(r) :  
    '''
    Write a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.
    '''

    """
    Find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.

    Parameters:
    r (float): The radius of the semicircle.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the largest triangle inscribed in the semicircle.
    """

    # Calculate the height of the triangle
    h = r

    # Calculate the base of the triangle
    b = 2 * math.sqrt(3) * h

    # Calculate the area of the triangle

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(7) == 49
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
