You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''

    # Create an empty dictionary to store the groups of tuples.
    groups = {}

    # Loop through each tuple in the input list.
    for tup in Input:
        # Get the first element of the tuple.
        key = tup[0]

        # If the key already exists in the dictionary, add the tuple to the existing group.
        if key in groups:
            groups[key].append(tup)
        # Otherwise, create a new group with the current tuple.
        else:
            groups[key] = [tup]

    # Return the dictionary of groups.
    return groups

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3), (1, 6)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
