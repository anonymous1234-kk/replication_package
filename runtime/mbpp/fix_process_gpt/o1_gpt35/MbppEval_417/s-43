You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input):

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the groups
    groups = {}
    
    # Iterate over the input tuples
    for tup in Input:
        # Check if the first element already exists in the dictionary
        if tup[0] in groups:
