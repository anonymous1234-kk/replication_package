I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def group_tuples(Input): 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to find common first element in given list of tuple.
    '''
    result = {}
    for tup in Input:
        if tup[0] not in result:
            result[tup[0]] = [tup]
        else:
            result[tup[0]].append(tup)
    return result

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 3), (2, 6), (1, 6), (4, 7)]) == [(1, 3), (1, 6)]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 4), (4, 9), (3, 6), (4, 8), (1, 9)]) == [1, 4]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert group_tuples([(1, 2), (2, 2)]) == []
assert group_tuples([(1, 2)]) == []
