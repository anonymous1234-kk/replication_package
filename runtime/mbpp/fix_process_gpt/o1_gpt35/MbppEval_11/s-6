You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''

    first_occ = s.find(ch)  # Find the index of the first occurrence of 'ch' in 's'
    last_occ = s.rfind(ch)  # Find the index of the last occurrence of 'ch' in 's'
    
    if first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1 and first_occ != last_occ:
        # If 'ch' is present in 's' and it's not the only occurrence of 'ch'
        s = s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ+1:last_occ] + s[last_occ+1:]
        # Remove the first and last occurrence of 'ch' from 's'
    
    return s  # Return the modified string

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_Occ('whatsup','w') == hatsup
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert remove_Occ('Merry Christmas','r') == Mery Chistmas
assert remove_Occ('Python and Machine Learning','n') == Pytho and Machine Learnig
assert remove_Occ('Python is a high level language','a') == Python is  high level languge
assert remove_Occ('pypypy','p') == ypyy
assert remove_Occ('bannana','n') == banaa
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
