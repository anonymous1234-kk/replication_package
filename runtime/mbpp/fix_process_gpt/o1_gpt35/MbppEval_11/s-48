You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def remove_Occ(s,ch): 
    '''
    Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
    '''
 
    # Find the index of the first occurrence of the character
    first_occurrence = s.find(ch)
    
    # Find the index of the last occurrence of the character
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(ch)
    
    # If the character is not found in the string, return the original string
    if first_occurrence == -1:
        return s
    
    # Remove the first occurrence of the character
    s = s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence+1:]
    
    # If the character is not found again, return the modified string
    if s.find(ch) == -1:
        return s
    
    # Remove the last occurrence of the character
    s = s[:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence+1:]
    
    # Return the final modified string
    return s

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_Occ('Merry Christmas','r') == Mery Chistmas
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
