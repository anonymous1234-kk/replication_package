You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
```

```python
import math 
def is_polite(n): 
    '''
    Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/
    '''
 
    # A polite number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers
    # First polite number is 1
    
    # First, we will find the smallest value of x such that n can be expressed as sum of first x positive integers
    x = math.ceil((-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 8 * n)) / 2)
    
    # Now, we will check if n can be expressed as sum of x consecutive integers
    m = int((x - 1) / 2)
    s = (m + 1) * (x - m)
    
    if s == n:
        return True
    else:
        return False

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_polite(4) == 7
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
