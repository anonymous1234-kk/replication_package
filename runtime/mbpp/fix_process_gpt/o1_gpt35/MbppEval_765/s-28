You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Certainly! Here's the fixed code:

        powerI = int(math.pow(2, i))
 
        # Iterate from 1 to i
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
 
            # Calculate the jth power of 2
            powerJ = int(math.pow(2, j))
 
            # Calculate the difference between powerI and powerJ
            diff = powerI - powerJ
 
            # If diff is divisible by (powerI / 2) or not 
            if (diff % (powerI // 2) == 0):
                politeCount += 1
 
                # If the current number is nth polite number
                if (politeCount == n):
                    return diff
