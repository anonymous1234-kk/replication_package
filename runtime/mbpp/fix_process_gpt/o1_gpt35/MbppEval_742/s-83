I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
import math
def area_tetrahedron(side):
    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''
```

```python
import math
def area_tetrahedron(side):
    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to caluclate the area of a tetrahedron.
    '''
    return math.sqrt(3) * side ** 2 / 4

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert area_tetrahedron(5) == 43.30127018922193
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
