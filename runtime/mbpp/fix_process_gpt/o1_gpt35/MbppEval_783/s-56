You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def rgb_to_hsv(r, g, b):
    '''
    Write a function to convert rgb color to hsv color. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-change-rgb-color-model-hsv-color-model/
    '''

    '''

    # R, G, B values are divided by 255
    # to change the range from 0..255 to 0..1:
    r, g, b = r / 255.0, g / 255.0, b / 255.0

    # h, s, v = hue, saturation, value
    cmax = max(r, g, b)    # maximum of r, g, b
    cmin = min(r, g, b)    # minimum of r, g, b
    diff = cmax-cmin       # diff of cmax and cmin.

    # if cmax and cmax are equal then h = 0
    if cmax == cmin:
        h = 0
    elif cmax == r:
        # if cmax is equal to red then h = ((g - b) / diff) % 6
        h = (60 * ((g - b) / diff) + 360) % 360
    elif cmax == g:
        # if cmax is equal to green then h = ((b - r) / diff) + 2
        h = (60 * ((b - r) / diff) + 120) % 360
    elif cmax == b:
        # if cmax is equal to blue then h = ((r - g) / diff) + 4
        h = (60 * ((r - g) / diff) + 240) % 360

    # if cmax is 0 then s = 0 else s = (diff / cmax)
    s = 0 if cmax == 0 else (diff / cmax)

    v = cmax

    return h, s, v

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert rgb_to_hsv(128,128,0) == (60, 100, 50)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
