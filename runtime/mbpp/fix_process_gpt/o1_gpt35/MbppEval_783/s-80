You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def rgb_to_hsv(r, g, b):
    '''
    Write a function to convert rgb color to hsv color. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-change-rgb-color-model-hsv-color-model/

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert rgb_to_hsv(128,128,0) == (60, 100, 50)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
