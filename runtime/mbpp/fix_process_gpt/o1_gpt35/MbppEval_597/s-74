I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

    '''

    len1 = len(arr1)

    i, j = 0, 0
    kth = 0
    while i < len1 and j < len2:

    while i < len1:
        kth = arr1[i]
        i += 1

    while j < len2:

            return kth
    return kth

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
