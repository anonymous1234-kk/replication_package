You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    """
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    """
    # Combine the two sorted arrays
    merged_arr = arr1 + arr2
    # Sort the merged array
    merged_arr.sort()
    # Return the kth element of the sorted merged array
    return merged_arr[k-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code that will pass all the given test cases:

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    merged_arr = []
    i = 0
    j = 0

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            merged_arr.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_arr.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1

    while i < len(arr1):
        merged_arr.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1

    while j < len(arr2):
        merged_arr.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged_arr[k]

```

This code will pass all the given test cases.
