I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    # Find the length of both the arrays
    n1 = len(arr1)
    n2 = len(arr2)
    
    # Initialize pointers for both arrays
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    # Initialize a counter
    count = 0
    
    # Loop till the counter reaches k or one of the arrays ends
    while i < n1 and j < n2:
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            # Increment the counter and move the pointer for the first array
            count += 1
            if count == k:
                return arr1[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            # Increment the counter and move the pointer for the second array
            count += 1
            if count == k:
                return arr2[j]
            j += 1
            
    # If kth element is not found yet and one of the arrays has reached its end
    while i < n1:
        count += 1
        if count == k:
            return arr1[i]
        i += 1
        
    while j < n2:
        count += 1
        if count == k:
            return arr2[j]
        j += 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
