You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    m, n = len(arr1), len(arr2)

    # Ensure arr1 is the shorter array
    if m > n:
        arr1, arr2, m, n = arr2, arr1, n, m

    # Initialize the pointers for binary search
    left, right = 0, m

    while left <= right:
        # Calculate the partition indices for arr1 and arr2
        i = (left + right) // 2
        j = k - i

        # Check if we have found the kth element
        if j == 0:
            return max(arr1[i-1] if i > 0 else float('-inf'), arr2[j-1] if j > 0 else float('-inf'))

        # If j is negative, move the partition of arr1 to the right
        if j < 0:
            right = i - 1

        # If j is positive and the ith element of arr1 is smaller than the j-1th element of arr2, move the partition of arr1 to the right
        elif i < m and arr1[i] < arr2[j-1]:
            left = i + 1

        # If j is positive and the j-1th element of arr1 is greater than the ith element of arr2, move the partition of arr1 to the left
        else:
            right = i - 1

    # If we have reached here, it means the kth element is not present in arr1
    # So, we find the (k-m)th element in arr2
    j = k - left
    return arr2[j-1] if j > 0 else float('-inf')

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],[9, 10, 11, 12, 13],14) == 13
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python

    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    m, n = len(arr1), len(arr2)

    # Ensure arr1 is the shorter array
    if m > n:
        arr1, arr2, m, n = arr2, arr1, n, m

    # Initialize the pointers for binary search
    left, right = 0, m

    while left <= right:
        # Calculate the partition indices for arr1 and arr2
        i = (left + right) // 2
        j = k - i

        # Check if we have found the kth element
        if j == 0:
            return max(arr1[i-1] if i > 0 else float('-inf'), arr2[j-1] if j > 0 else float('-inf'))

        # If j is negative, move the partition of arr1 to the right
        if j < 0:
            right = i - 1

        # If j is positive and the ith element of arr1 is smaller than the j-1th element of arr2, move the partition of arr1 to the right
        elif i < m and arr1[i] < arr2[j-1]:
            left = i + 1

        # If j is positive and the j-1th element of arr1 is greater than the ith element of arr2, move the partition of arr1 to the left
        else:
            right = i - 1

    # If we have reached here, it means the kth element is not present in arr1
    # So, we find the (k-m)th element in arr2
    j = k - left
    return arr2[j-1] if j > 0 else arr1[left-1] if left > 0 else float('-inf')
