You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    """
    Returns the kth element from the given two sorted arrays.

    Args:
        arr1 (list): First sorted array.
        arr2 (list): Second sorted array.
        k (int): The kth element to find.

    Returns:
        int or float: The kth element from the given two sorted arrays.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If k is greater than the total length of both arrays.
    """

    # Make sure k is within the bounds of the arrays.
    if k > len(arr1) + len(arr2):
        raise ValueError("k is greater than the total length of both arrays")

    # Merge the two arrays.
    merged = sorted(arr1 + arr2)

    # Return the kth element.
    return merged[k - 1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8],0) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
