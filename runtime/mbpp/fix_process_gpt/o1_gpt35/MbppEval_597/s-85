I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''
```

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays.
    '''

    n1, n2 = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    
    # If length of array1 is greater than or equal to the kth element,
    # then return the kth element from array2
    if k <= n1:
        return arr1[k-1]
    
    # If length of array2 is greater than or equal to the kth element,
    # then return the kth element from array2
    elif k <= n2:
        return arr2[k-1]
    
    # If kth element is greater than the sum of lengths of two arrays,
    # then it is not possible to find the kth element in the merged array
    elif k > n1 + n2:
        return -1
    
    # Now, we need to merge two arrays such that the merged array is sorted
    # and then find the kth element in it
    else:
        # Merge two arrays
        merged_array = sorted(arr1 + arr2)
        
        # Return the kth element from merged array
        return merged_array[k-1]

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9],[1, 4, 8, 10],3) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],[9, 10, 11, 12, 13],14) == 13
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4, 5],[6, 7, 8, 9, 10],6) == 6
assert find_kth([1, 2, 3, 4, 5],[6, 7, 8, 9, 10],7) == 7
assert find_kth([3, 6, 9, 12, 15],[8, 10, 11, 13],8) == 13
assert find_kth([1, 3, 5],[2, 4, 6],1) == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    n1, n2 = len(arr1), len(arr2)
    
    if k <= n1:
        return arr1[k-1]
    
    elif k <= n2:
        return arr2[k-1]
    
    elif k > n1 + n2:
        return -1
    
    else:
        merged_array = []
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        while i < n1 and j < n2:
            if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
                merged_array.append(arr1[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                merged_array.append(arr2[j])
                j += 1
        
        while i < n1:
            merged_array.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        
        while j < n2:
            merged_array.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
        
        return merged_array[k-1]
```
