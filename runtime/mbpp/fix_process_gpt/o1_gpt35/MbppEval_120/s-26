I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    max_product = 0
    for a, b in list1:
        product = abs(a * b)
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product
    return max_product

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product_tuple([(4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 5), (10, 11), (6, 7)]) == 99
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
