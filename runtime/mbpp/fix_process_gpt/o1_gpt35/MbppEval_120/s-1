You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def max_product_tuple(list1):
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.
    '''

    max_product = 0
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(list1)):
            product = abs(list1[i][0]*list1[j][0]) * abs(list1[i][1]*list1[j][1])
            max_product = max(max_product, product)

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_product_tuple([(4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 5), (10, 11), (6, 7)]) == 99
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
