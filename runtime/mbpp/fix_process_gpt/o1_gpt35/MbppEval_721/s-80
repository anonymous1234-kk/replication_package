I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def maxAverageOfPath(cost):
    '''
    Given a square matrix of size N*N given as a list of lists, where each cell is associated with a specific cost. A path is defined as a specific sequence of cells that starts from the top-left cell move only right or down and ends on bottom right cell. We want to find a path with the maximum average over all existing paths. Average is computed as total cost divided by the number of cells visited in the path.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 1], [1, 1, 1]]) == 1.6
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) == 2.6666666666666665
assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 0], [1, 0]]) == 0.6666666666666666
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
