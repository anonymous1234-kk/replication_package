You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def removezero_ip(ip):
    '''
    Write a function to remove leading zeroes from an ip address.
    '''

    # Split the IP address into its four parts, separated by dots
    parts = ip.split(".")

    # Remove leading zeroes from each part of the IP address
    for i in range(len(parts)):
        parts[i] = re.sub("^0+", "", parts[i])

    # Join the modified parts of the IP address back together
    modified_ip = ".".join(parts)

    return modified_ip

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert removezero_ip('1.0.01.02-5') == 1.0.1.2-5
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert removezero_ip('144.256.011.025') == 144.256.11.25
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
