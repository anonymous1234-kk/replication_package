You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_two_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def text_match_two_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.
    '''

    pattern = r'a(b{2,3})'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_two_three('bab') == Not matched!
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
