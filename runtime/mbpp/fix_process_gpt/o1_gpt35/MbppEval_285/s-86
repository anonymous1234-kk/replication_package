You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_two_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.
    '''
```

```python
import re
def text_match_two_three(text):
    '''
    Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.
    '''

    # ^ matches the start of a string
    # .* matches any character (except for a newline) - zero or more times
    # a matches the character a literally (case sensitive)
    # b matches the character b literally (case sensitive)
    # {2,3} matches the previous character (in this case b) exactly 2 or 3 times
    # $ matches the end of the string
    return re.match('^.*a(b{2,3}).*$', text) is not None

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_two_three('bab') == Not matched!
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
