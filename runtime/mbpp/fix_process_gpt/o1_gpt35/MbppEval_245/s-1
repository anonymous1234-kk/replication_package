I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize dp array with all values as 0
    dp = [0 for i in range(n)]

    # Compute the maximum increasing subsequence sum
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i])

    # Compute the maximum decreasing subsequence sum
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, i, -1):
            if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i])

    # Find the maximum bitonic subsequence sum
    max_sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i])

    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 18, 17, 11, 7]) == 130
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
