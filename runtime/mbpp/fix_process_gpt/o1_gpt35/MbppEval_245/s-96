You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''

    n = len(arr)
    left = [0] * n
    right = [0] * n

    left[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        left[i] = max(left[i-1], arr[i])

    right[n-1] = arr[n-1]
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        right[i] = max(right[i+1], arr[i])

    max_sum = float("-inf")
    for i in range(n):
        max_sum = max(max_sum, left[i] + right[i] - arr[i])
    
    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
