I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''
```

def max_sum(arr): 
    '''
    Write a function that takes an array and finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array, where a sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.
    '''

    n = len(arr)

    # find the longest increasing subsequence from left to right
    lis = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)

    # find the longest decreasing subsequence from right to left
    lds = [1] * n
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                lds[i] = max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1)

    # find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence
    max_sum = lis[0] + lds[0] - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_sum = max(max_sum, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1)

    return max_sum

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert max_sum([80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10]) == 210
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
