I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''
```

```python
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''
 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''
    result = []
    for i in test_tuple:
        if isinstance(i, tuple):
            result.append(even_ele(i, even_fnc))
        elif even_fnc(i):
            result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_ele((1, 2, 3),[]) == (2,)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
