I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''

    # Initialize an empty list to store the even elements
    even_lst = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the tuple
    for ele in test_tuple:
        # If the element is a tuple, call the function recursively on the element
        if type(ele) == tuple:
            even_lst.append(even_ele(ele, even_fnc))
        # If the element is not a tuple, apply the even_fnc on the element to check if it's even
        else:
            if even_fnc(ele):
                even_lst.append(ele)
    
    # Return the list of even elements
    return tuple(even_lst)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_ele((1, 2, 3),[]) == (2,)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
