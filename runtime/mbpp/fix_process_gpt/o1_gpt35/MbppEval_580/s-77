I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def even_ele(test_tuple, even_fnc): 
    '''
    Write a function to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple.
    '''

    # create an empty list to store the even elements
    even_list = []
  
    # loop through each element in the test_tuple
    for item in test_tuple:
        # if the current element is a tuple, call the function recursively
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            even_list.append(even_ele(item, even_fnc))
        # if the current element satisfies the condition of the even_fnc, add it to the even_list
        elif even_fnc(item):
            even_list.append(item)
  
    # return the even_list as a tuple
    return tuple(even_list)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_ele((1, 2, 3),[]) == (2,)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
