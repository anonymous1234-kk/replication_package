You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def remove_length(test_str, K):
    '''
    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def remove_length(test_str, K):
    '''
    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string.
    '''

    # split the string into words
    words = test_str.split()

    # loop through each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # if the length of the word is K, remove it from the list of words
        if len(word) == K:
            words.remove(word)

    # join the remaining words in the list back into a string
    new_str = " ".join(words)
    
    return new_str

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_length('I have written a code for you',3) == I have written a code
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert remove_length('This is a sample text and this is just an example.',2) == This a sample text and this just example.
assert remove_length('Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. ',3) == Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr ltteers in a wrod are, olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht frist lsat ltteer be at rghit pclae.
assert remove_length('This is a sample text and this is just an example.',4) == is a sample and is an example.
assert remove_length('Java programming is OOPs based.',2) == Java programming OOPs based.
assert remove_length('Java programming is OOPs based.',3) == Java programming is OOPs based.
assert remove_length('python is very interesting to learn',2) == python very interesting learn
assert remove_length('python is very interesting to learn',3) == python is very interesting to learn
assert remove_length('This is a sample text and this is just an example.',2) == This a sample text and this just example.
assert remove_length('Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.

assert remove_length('This is a sample text and this is just an example.',4) == is a sample and is an example.
assert remove_length('This is a test string',2) == This a test string
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

```python
def remove_length(test_str, K):
    words = test_str.split()
    words = [word for word in words if len(word) != K]
    new_str = " ".join(words)
    return new_str
```
