You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def remove_length(test_str, K):
    '''
    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string.
    '''
```

```python
def remove_length(test_str, K):
    '''
    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string.
    '''
    # split the string into words
    words = test_str.split()
  
    # loop through each word in words list
    for word in words:
  
        # if length of word is not equal to k
        if len(word) != K:
            print(word, end = " ")

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_length('This is a sample text and this is just an example.',2) == This a sample text and this just example.
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

    Write a function to remove all the words with k length in the given string.

    # split the string into words
    words = test_str.split()

    # create an empty list to store the filtered words

    # loop through each word in words list
    for word in words:

            filtered_words.append(word)

    # join the filtered words using space as separator
    result = " ".join(filtered_words)

    return result
