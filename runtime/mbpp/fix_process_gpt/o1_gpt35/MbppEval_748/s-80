You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def capital_words_spaces(str1):
    '''
    Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import re
def capital_words_spaces(str1):
    '''
    Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.
    '''

    return re.sub(r"(\w)([A-Z])", r"\1 \2", str1)

```

----------------------User Message----------------------
The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert capital_words_spaces('ABCDEF') == A B C D E F
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
