You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import re
def text_match_zero_one(text):
    '''
    Write a function that matches a string that has an 'a' followed by one or more 'b's. https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/re/python-re-exercise-3.php
    '''
```

    return bool(match)  # return True if match is found, False otherwise

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert text_match_zero_one('ab') == Found a match!
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
