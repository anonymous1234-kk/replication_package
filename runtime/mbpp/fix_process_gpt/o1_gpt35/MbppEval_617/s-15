I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
```

def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''

    x, y = 0, 0 # Initialize the starting point
    jump_count = 0 # Initialize jump counter
    while x < d or y != 0: # Check if we haven't reached the destination yet
        x += steps # Move forward by the given step size
        jump_count += 1 # Increment the jump counter
        if x >= d: # Check if we've overshot the destination
            break
        x -= steps # Move back by the given step size
        jump_count += 1 # Increment the jump counter
        y += steps # Move up by the given step size
    return jump_count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(4,6) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
