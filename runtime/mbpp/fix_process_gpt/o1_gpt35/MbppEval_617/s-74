You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''

    # Calculate the distance from origin to (d, 0)
    distance = ((d ** 2) + (0 ** 2)) ** 0.5
    
    # Calculate the number of jumps required to cover the distance
    jumps = distance // steps

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(2,1) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
