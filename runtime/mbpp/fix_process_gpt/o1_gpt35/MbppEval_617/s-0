You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
```

def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''

    # Initialize the position coordinates and jump count
    x = 0
    y = 0
    jumps = 0
    
    # Check if the current position is below the target point
    while y < d:
        # Jump the maximum possible distance
        y += steps
        jumps += 1
        
        # Check if the next jump goes beyond the target point
        if y >= d:
            # Calculate the remaining distance and jump to the target point
            remaining = d - (y - steps)
            jumps += (remaining + steps - 1) // steps
    
    return jumps

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(4,6) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
