I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(8,3) == 2

 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert min_Jumps(2,2) == 1
assert min_Jumps(4,8) == 2
assert min_Jumps(7,7) == 1
assert min_Jumps(3,3) == 1
