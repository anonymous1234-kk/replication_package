You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
```

    '''

    x, y = 0, 0  # initialize the starting point as (0,0)
    jump_count = 0  # initialize the number of jumps to 0
    while y < d:  # loop until we reach the point (d,0) or beyond
        y += steps  # jump forward in the y direction by the given step size
        jump_count += 1  # increment the number of jumps taken
        if y >= d:  # if we have crossed the point (d,0), break out of the loop
            break
        x += steps  # jump forward in the x direction by the given step size

    return jump_count

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(2,1) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
