I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
```

```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''

    # Initialize the variables
    x = 0
    y = 0
    jumps = 0

    # Loop until we reach the destination
    while x < d:
        # Try to take a step of maximum length
        for i in range(steps, 0, -1):
            # Check if the step takes us beyond the destination
            if x + i >= d:
                x += i
                jumps += 1
                break

        # If we couldn't take a step of maximum length,
        # take a step of length 1 instead
        else:
            x += 1
            jumps += 1

    return jumps

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(4,6) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
