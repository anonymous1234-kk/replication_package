I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
```

def min_Jumps(steps, d): 
    '''
    Write a function to check for the number of jumps required of given length to reach a point of form (d, 0) from origin in a 2d plane.
    '''
 
    jump = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos < d:
        for i in range(steps, 0, -1):
            if pos + i >= d:
                pos += i
                jump += 1
                break
    return jump

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert min_Jumps(4,6) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
