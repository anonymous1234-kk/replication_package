I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    # initialize counters for 0s and 1s
    count0 = 0
    count1 = 0

    # initialize maximum difference as -1
    max_diff = -1

    # iterate over the input string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # increment the counters based on the current character
        if string[i] == '0':
            count0 += 1
        else:
            count1 += 1

        # calculate the difference between the counters and update max_diff if necessary
        diff = count0 - count1
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff

        # reset the counters if they become negative
        if count0 < 0:
            count0 = 0
        if count1 < 0:
            count1 = 0

    # return the maximum difference
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
