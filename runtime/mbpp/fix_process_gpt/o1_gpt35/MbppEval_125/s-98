I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    n = len(string)
    count = [0] * (n+1)
    count[0] = 1 if string[0] == '0' else -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        count[i] = count[i-1] + 1 if string[i] == '0' else count[i-1] - 1
    max_diff = 0
    min_count, max_count = 0, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if count[i] < min_count:
            min_count = count[i]
        if count[i] > max_count:
            max_count = count[i]
        diff = max_count - min_count
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
