I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    # Initialize variables to store the count of 0s and 1s
    count_zero = 0
    count_one = 0

    # Initialize variables to store the maximum difference and current difference
    max_diff = 0
    curr_diff = 0

    # Loop through the string
    for char in string:
        # If the character is 0, increment count_zero
        if char == '0':
            count_zero += 1
        # If the character is 1, increment count_one
        else:
            count_one += 1

        # Calculate the current difference and update max_diff if necessary
        curr_diff = count_zero - count_one
        if curr_diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = curr_diff

        # If curr_diff becomes negative, reset the counts
        if curr_diff < 0:
            count_zero = 0
            count_one = 0

    # Return the maximum difference
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11111111') == -1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_length('0000100') == 5
assert find_length('0011101') == 2
assert find_length('0') == 1
assert find_length('00000000000000') == 14
assert find_length('11100100100000') == 7
assert find_length('101010') == 1
assert find_length('01010101010101') == 1
assert find_length('11101010101111') == 1
assert find_length('1010') == 1
assert find_length('0000000000') == 10
assert find_length('00100101') == 3
assert find_length('110110110') == 1
assert find_length('0111') == 1
assert find_length('1000') == 3
assert find_length('111000') == 3
assert find_length('11011') == 1
assert find_length('1101010110') == 1
assert find_length('0101010101') == 1
assert find_length('0000011111') == 5
assert find_length('001110001') == 3
assert find_length('1101011001101101') == 2
assert find_length('010101011101010') == 1
assert find_length('000111000111111000000') == 6
assert find_length('1011010101010101') == 1
assert find_length('1110001101011010') == 3
assert find_length('1010110') == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
