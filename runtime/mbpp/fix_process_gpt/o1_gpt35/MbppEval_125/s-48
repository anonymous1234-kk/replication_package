You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
 
    n = len(string) 
    count_0 = 0
    count_1 = 0
    diff = 0

    for i in range(n): 
        if string[i] == '0': 
            count_0 += 1
        else: 
            count_1 += 1 
        if count_0 - count_1 > diff: 
            diff = count_0 - count_1 
        if count_1 - count_0 > diff: 
            diff = count_1 - count_0 
    return diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
