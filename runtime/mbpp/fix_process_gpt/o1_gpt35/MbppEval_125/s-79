I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    # initialize variables to store number of 0s and 1s
    zeros = ones = diff = max_diff = 0
    
    # loop through each character in the string
    for char in string:
        
        # increment the count of 1s if the character is '1'
        if char == '1':
            ones += 1
        # increment the count of 0s if the character is '0'
        elif char == '0':

        diff = ones - zeros
        
        # check if the difference is greater than the maximum difference seen so far
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
        
        # if the difference becomes negative, reset the count of 0s and 1s
        if diff < 0:

    # return the maximum difference

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
