I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

    '''

    n = len(string)
    count = [0]*(n+1)
    count[0] = 1 if string[0] == '0' else -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        count[i] = count[i-1] + (1 if string[i] == '0' else -1)
    max_len = 0
    minn, maxx = min(count), max(count)
    bucket = [-1]*(maxx-minn+1)
    for i in range(n):

        if bucket[count[i]-minn] != -1:
            max_len = max(max_len, i-bucket[count[i]-minn])
        else:

    return max_len

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
