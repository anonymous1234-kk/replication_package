I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
 
    # Initialize variables to keep track of counts and maximum difference
    zero_count, one_count = 0, 0
    max_diff = 0

    # Iterate over the string
    for char in string:
        # Update counts based on current character
        if char == '0':
            zero_count += 1
        else:
            one_count += 1

        # Update the maximum difference
        diff = one_count - zero_count
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
        
        # If we have more 1s than 0s, reset zero count
        if one_count < zero_count:
            zero_count = one_count = 0

    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
