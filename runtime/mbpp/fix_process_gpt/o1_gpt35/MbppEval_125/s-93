I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

    '''
 
    count = 0
    max_len = -1
    n = len(string)
    for i in range(n):
        if string[i] == '0':
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1
        if count in (1, -1):
            max_len = max(max_len, i + 1)
        if count not in (-1, 1):
            if count in d:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - d[count])
            else:
                d[count] = i
    return max_len

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11001110101011') == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
