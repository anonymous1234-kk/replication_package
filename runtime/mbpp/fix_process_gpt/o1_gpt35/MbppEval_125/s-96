I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''
```

```python
def find_length(string): 
    '''
    Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.
    '''

    zero_count = 0 # to count number of 0s
    one_count = 0 # to count number of 1s
    max_diff = 0 # to store maximum difference between 0s and 1s in any sub-string
    for char in string:
        if char == '0':
            zero_count += 1
        else:
            one_count += 1
        diff = zero_count - one_count # calculate difference between 0s and 1s
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff # update max_diff if the current difference is greater
        if diff < 0: # if the difference becomes negative
            zero_count = 0 # reset zero_count
            one_count = 0 # reset one_count
    return max_diff

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_length('11111111') == -1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert find_length('0000100') == 5
assert find_length('0011101') == 2
assert find_length('0') == 1
assert find_length('00000000000000') == 14
assert find_length('11100100100000') == 7
assert find_length('101010') == 1
assert find_length('01010101010101') == 1
assert find_length('11101010101111') == 1
assert find_length('1010') == 1
assert find_length('0000000000') == 10
assert find_length('00100101') == 3
assert find_length('110110110') == 1
assert find_length('0111') == 1
assert find_length('1000') == 3
assert find_length('111000') == 3
assert find_length('11011') == 1
assert find_length('1101010110') == 1
assert find_length('0101010101') == 1
assert find_length('0000011111') == 5
assert find_length('001110001') == 3
assert find_length('1101011001101101') == 2
assert find_length('010101011101010') == 1
assert find_length('000111000111111000000') == 6
assert find_length('1011010101010101') == 1
assert find_length('1110001101011010') == 3
assert find_length('1010110') == 1
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
