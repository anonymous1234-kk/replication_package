I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    '''

    '''

    # Initialize two empty arrays to store negative and positive numbers respectively
    neg_arr = []
    pos_arr = []
  
    # Traverse through the given array and store negative numbers in one array and positive numbers in another array
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] < 0:
            neg_arr.append(arr[i])
        else:
            pos_arr.append(arr[i])
    
    # Merge the two arrays to get the final result
    arr[:len(neg_arr)] = neg_arr
    arr[len(neg_arr):] = pos_arr

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([1, 2, 3, -1, 2],1) == [1, 2, 3, -1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
