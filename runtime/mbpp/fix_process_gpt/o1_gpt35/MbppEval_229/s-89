I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    # Initialize left and right pointers
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        # If the left element is negative, move the left pointer to the right
        if arr[left] < 0:
            left += 1
        # If the right element is positive, move the right pointer to the left
        elif arr[right] > 0:
            right -= 1
        # If the left element is positive and the right element is negative, swap them
        else:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([1, 2, 3, -1, 2],1) == [1, 2, 3, -1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
