I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def re_arrange_array(arr, n):
    '''
    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.
    '''
```

    # initialize variables to keep track of the position of the first positive element and the last negative element
    pos_index = n

            # if we encounter a negative element, we swap it with the element at neg_index
            arr[i], arr[neg_index] = arr[neg_index], arr[i]
            # we update the index of the last negative element
            neg_index += 1

    # iterate through the array again, and move positive elements to the end of the array
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            # if we encounter a positive element, we swap it with the element at pos_index
            arr[i], arr[pos_index] = arr[pos_index], arr[i]
            # we update the index of the first positive element
            pos_index += 1

    # return the re-arranged array
    return arr

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert re_arrange_array([1, 2, 3, -1, 2],1) == [1, 2, 3, -1, 2]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
