Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    # Calculate the lateral surface area of the pyramid
    lsa = 0.5 * s * b
    
    # Calculate the base area of the pyramid
    ba = b ** 2
    
    # Calculate the total surface area of the pyramid
    tsa = lsa + ba
    
    # Return the total surface area
