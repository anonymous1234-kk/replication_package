I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
    # Calculate the area of each triangular face
    area_triangle = b * s / 2
    
    # Calculate the area of the square base

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(1,2) == 5.123105625617661
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
