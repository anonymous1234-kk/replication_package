Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
 
    area = b ** 2 + 2 * b * s # Calculate the surface area of the square pyramid using the given formula
    return area # Return the calculated surface area
