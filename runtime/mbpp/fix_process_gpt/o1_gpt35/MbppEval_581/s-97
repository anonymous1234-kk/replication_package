Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    '''
    Calculate the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.

    Parameters:
    b (float): Base edge of the square pyramid.
    s (float): Slant height of the square pyramid.

    Returns:
    float: Surface area of the square pyramid.
    '''
    area = b * (b + 2 * s)
    return area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(1,2) == 5.123105625617661
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
