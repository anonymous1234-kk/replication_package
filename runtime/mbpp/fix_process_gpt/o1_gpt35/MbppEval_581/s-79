Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
    # Calculate the slant height of the pyramid using the Pythagorean theorem
    l = (b**2 + 4 * s**2)**0.5
    
    # Calculate the surface area using the formula
    A = b**2 + 2 * b * l
    
    # Return the calculated surface area
    return A

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(3,4) == 34.63201123595259
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
