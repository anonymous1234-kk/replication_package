I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def surface_Area(b,s): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the surface area of a square pyramid with a given base edge and height.
    '''

    # calculate the slant height of the pyramid
    l = ((b/2)**2 + s**2)**0.5

    # calculate the surface area of the pyramid
    surface_area = b**2 + 2*b*l

    # return the surface area
    return surface_area

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert surface_Area(7,5) == 119
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
