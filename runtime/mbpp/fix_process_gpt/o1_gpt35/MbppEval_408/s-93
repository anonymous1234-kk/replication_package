I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import heapq
def k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k):
    '''
    Write a function to find k number of smallest pairs which consist of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.
    '''

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert k_smallest_pairs([1, 5, 7, 8, 9],[2, 4, 6],4) == [[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [5, 2]]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
