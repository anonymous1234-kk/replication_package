You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def next_power_of_2(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
def next_power_of_2(n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.
    '''
 
    # decrement the number by 1 and then take the log base 2
    # we add 1 to the result of log base 2 to get the power of 2
    return 2**(math.ceil(math.log2(n)))

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert next_power_of_2(36) == 64
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
