I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
 
    # Convert the binary string to a list of integers.
    s = [int(x) for x in s]
    
    # Create a new list to store the number of odd numbers obtained after each rotation.
    odd_counts = []
    
    # Perform n rotations and check the number of odd numbers obtained each time.
    for i in range(n):
        rotated_s = s[i:] + s[:i]
        odd_count = sum(x % 2 == 1 for x in rotated_s)
        odd_counts.append(odd_count)
    
    # Count the number of times an odd number was obtained.
    odd_occurrences = sum(x > 0 for x in odd_counts)
    return odd_occurrences

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
