I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''

    count = 0
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    s_int = int(s, 2)
    # Loop through the number of rotations
    for i in range(n):
        # Rotate the binary representation of the integer by 1 bit to the left
        s_int = (s_int << 1) | (s_int >> (len(s) - 1))
        # Check if the value of the rotated integer is odd
        if s_int % 2 == 1:

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('010101',1) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
