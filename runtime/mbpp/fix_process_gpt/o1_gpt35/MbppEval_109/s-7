I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
