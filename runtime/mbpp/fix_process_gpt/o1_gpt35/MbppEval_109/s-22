You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''

    # Count the number of 1s in the binary string
    count_ones = s.count('1')
    
    # If the number of rotations is even, then the number of odd numbers will be equal to the number of even numbers
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return count_ones * (len(s) - count_ones)
    
    # If the number of rotations is odd, then the number of odd numbers will be equal to the number of 1s and 0s
    else:
        return count_ones ** 2 + (len(s) - count_ones) ** 2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
