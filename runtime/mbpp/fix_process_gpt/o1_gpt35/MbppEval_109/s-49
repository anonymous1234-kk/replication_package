I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
 
    # Convert binary string to integer
    s_int = int(s, 2)
  
    # Number of bits in the binary string

    # Number of odd numbers
    num_odd = 0
  
    # Loop through all possible rotations

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Certainly! Here's the fixed code:

```python

    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
 
    # Convert binary string to integer
    s_int = int(s, 2)
  
    # Number of bits in the binary string
    num_bits = len(s)
  
    # Number of odd numbers
    num_odd = 0
  
    # Loop through all possible rotations
    for i in range(num_bits):
        # Rotate the binary string to the right
        s_int = ((s_int & 1) << (num_bits - 1)) | (s_int >> 1)
        # Check if the value of the rotated binary string is odd
        if s_int % 2 != 0:
            num_odd += 1
