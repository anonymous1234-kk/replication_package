I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''

    # Count the number of 1's in the original string s
    ones = s.count('1')

    # If the number of rotations is even, then all the numbers will have the same parity as the original string
    # If the number of rotations is odd, then the number of 1's in the resulting string will be equal to the number of 0's
    # Therefore, the number of odd numbers will be equal to the minimum of ones and n - ones
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return len(s) if ones == 0 or ones == len(s) else 0
    else:
        return min(ones, len(s) - ones)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
