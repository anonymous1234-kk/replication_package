You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
```

```python
def odd_Equivalent(s,n): 
    '''
    Write a python function to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
    '''
 
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    num = int(s, 2)

    # Compute the number of bits in the binary string
    bits = len(s)

    # Rotate the bits to the left by n positions
    rotated_num = ((num << n) | (num >> (bits - n))) & ((1 << bits) - 1)

    # Count the number of bits with an odd value in the rotated number
    count = 0
    while rotated_num:
        if rotated_num & 1:
            count += 1
        rotated_num >>= 1

    # Return the count
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert odd_Equivalent('1010101',3) == 2
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
