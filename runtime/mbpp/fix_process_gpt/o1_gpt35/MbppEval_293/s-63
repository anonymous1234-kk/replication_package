You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
import math
def otherside_rightangle(w,h):
    '''
    Write a function to find the third side of a right angled triangle.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
import math
def otherside_rightangle(w,h):
    '''
    Write a function to find the third side of a right angled triangle.
    '''

    # Find the length of the third side of a right angled triangle
    # given the lengths of the other two sides.

    # First, find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the
    # Pythagorean theorem.
    hypotenuse = math.sqrt(w ** 2 + h ** 2)

    # Then, use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of the
    # third side, which is the side opposite the right angle.
    third_side = math.sqrt(hypotenuse ** 2 - w ** 2)

    return third_side

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert otherside_rightangle(3.5,5.5) == 6.519202405202649
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert otherside_rightangle(0,0) == 0.0
assert otherside_rightangle(0,5) == 5.0
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
