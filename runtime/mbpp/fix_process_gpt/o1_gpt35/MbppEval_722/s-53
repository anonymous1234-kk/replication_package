You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
def filter_data(students,h,w):
    '''
    The input is given as - a dictionary with a student name as a key and a tuple of float (student_height, student_weight) as a value, - minimal height, - minimal weight. Write a function to filter students that have height and weight above the minimum.
    '''
```

    '''

    """
    Filters a dictionary of student information based on height and weight.

    Args:
        students (dict): A dictionary with student names as keys and tuples of height and weight as values.
        h (float): The minimum height required to be included in the filtered dictionary.
        w (float): The minimum weight required to be included in the filtered dictionary.

    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with only the students who meet the minimum height and weight requirements.

    """

    filtered_students = {}

    for name, (height, weight) in students.items():
        if height >= h and weight >= w:
            filtered_students[name] = (height, weight)

    return filtered_students

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert filter_data({'Dima': (1.8, 70), 'Tima': (1.6, 50), 'Lena': (1.67, 55), 'Fima': (1.77, 98), 'Mima': (1.87, 67)},1.8,50) == {'Mima': (1.87, 67)}
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
