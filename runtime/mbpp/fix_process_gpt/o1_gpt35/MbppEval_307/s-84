I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
    '''
    Write a function to get a colon of a tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
    '''
    Write a function to get a colon of a tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to get a colon of a tuple.
    '''
    return deepcopy(tuplex[m:n])

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert colon_tuplex(('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'),1,2) == ('a', 'e')
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert colon_tuplex((1, 2, 3),0,5) == (1, 2, 3)
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
