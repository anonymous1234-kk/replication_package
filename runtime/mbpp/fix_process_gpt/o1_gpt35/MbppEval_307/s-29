I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
    '''
    Write a function to get a colon of a tuple.
    '''
```

----------------------Assistant Message----------------------
```python
from copy import deepcopy
def colon_tuplex(tuplex,m,n):
    '''
    Write a function to get a colon of a tuple.
    '''

    '''
    Write a function to get a colon of a tuple.
    '''
    # creating a deepcopy of the input tuplex
    tuplex_copy = deepcopy(tuplex)
    
    # slicing the deepcopy to get a colon of the tuple
    colon_tuplex = tuplex_copy[m:n+1]
    
    # returning the colon tuple
    return colon_tuplex

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert colon_tuplex(('red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue'),2,2) == ()
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert colon_tuplex((1, 2, 3),0,5) == (1, 2, 3)
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
