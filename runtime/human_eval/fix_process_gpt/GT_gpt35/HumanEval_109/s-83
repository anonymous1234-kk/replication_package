You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert move_one_ball([5, 2, 3, 4, 1]) == False
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert move_one_ball([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]) == False
assert move_one_ball([4, 1, 3, 5, 2]) == False
assert move_one_ball([2, 3, 1, 4, 5]) == False
assert move_one_ball([5, 4, 3, 1, 2]) == False
assert move_one_ball([3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10]) == False
assert move_one_ball([2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == False
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
