You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
```

    """

    # Use the split() function to split the string into a list of words.
    # The split() function takes an optional delimiter as an argument.
    # If no delimiter is specified, it splits the string on whitespace characters.
    # In this case, we want to split the string on both commas and spaces.
    # We can achieve this by passing a regular expression that matches both commas and spaces as the delimiter.
    # The regular expression we need is ",\s+|\s+"
    # This matches one or more whitespace characters (\s+) preceded by a comma (,) OR
    # one or more whitespace characters (\s+) NOT preceded by a comma (,)
    # We then call the split() function with the regular expression as the delimiter to split the string into words.
    words = re.split(",\s+|\s+", s)
    # Return the list of words.
    return words

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert words_string("Life is not always easy, but it's worth it.") == ['Life', 'is', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'but', "it's", 'worth', 'it.']
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
