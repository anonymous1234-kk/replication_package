I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_bored('This is a test. I am happy. I am bored? I am bored! I am bored') == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert is_bored('I am happy. I love my family. I love this weather') == 3
assert is_bored('I am not feeling bored. I am happy.') == 2
assert is_bored('I am happy. I am going to the beach. Do you want to come?') == 2
assert is_bored('I will be on holiday. It will be in Turkey. I am excited') == 2
assert is_bored("I'm reading a book. It's so good. I'm almost finished with it.") == 0
assert is_bored('I am excited. This is a test. I am bored. I do not want to do this') == 3
assert is_bored('I am tired.I need a vacation? Are you coming! Let me know.') == 2
assert is_bored("I am really bored. Please let's go to the mall?") == 1
assert is_bored('I am happy and sad. I am not sad. I am happy again!') == 3
assert is_bored("I'm getting bored. Why are you here?") == 0
assert is_bored('I am an engineer. I live in Austin! my favorite team is Dallas Mavericks') == 2
assert is_bored('I need to go shopping. I have run out of milk. I am so thirsty. I think I will go now!') == 4
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
