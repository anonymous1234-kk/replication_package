You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
    For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
    For num = "2020" the output should be 2.
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert hex_key('15') == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
