You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    Examples:
    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10
    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert skjkasdkd([18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98]) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert skjkasdkd([10, 12, 55, 44, 85, 94, 70, 95, 64, 57, 76, 49, 7, 74, 80, 72, 22, 34, 8, 95, 19, 49, 4, 80, 28, 97, 12, 15, 76, 43, 68, 29, 4, 6, 59, 97, 51, 63, 37, 58, 59, 52, 8, 94, 11, 91, 2, 79, 85, 43, 38]) == 16
assert skjkasdkd([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 7
assert skjkasdkd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]) == 10
assert skjkasdkd([7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31]) == 4
assert skjkasdkd([0, 725, 32, 71, 99, 32, 6, 0, 5, 91, 83, 0, 5, 6]) == 11
assert skjkasdkd([3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11]) == 2
assert skjkasdkd([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]) == 2
assert skjkasdkd([2, 3, 5, 7, 11]) == 2

.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
