I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''

    result = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0:
            result += num ** 2
    return result * 2

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert double_the_difference([4, 5, -2, 6, -9, -3]) == 25
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
