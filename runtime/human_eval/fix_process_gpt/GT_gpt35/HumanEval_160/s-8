I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python

def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert do_algebra(['+', '-', '*', '+'],[2, 3, 4, 5]) == -15
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert do_algebra(['*', '+'],[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 5
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
