You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """
```

    even_count = 0

    # convert the number to a string and iterate over each character
    for digit in str(abs(num)):
        if int(digit) % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1

    # if the original number was negative, negate the even and odd counts
    if num < 0:
        even_count *= -1
        odd_count *= -1

    # return a tuple of the even and odd counts
    return (even_count, odd_count)

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert even_odd_count(-245632) == (4, 2)
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
