You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == [1, 4, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
