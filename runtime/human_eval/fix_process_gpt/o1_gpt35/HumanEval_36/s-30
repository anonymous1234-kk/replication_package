You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
```

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)

    >>> fizz_buzz(78)

    >>> fizz_buzz(79)

    """

    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0) and str(7) in str(i):
            count += 1
    return count

```

----------------------User Message----------------------
The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert fizz_buzz(100) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert fizz_buzz(0) == 0
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
