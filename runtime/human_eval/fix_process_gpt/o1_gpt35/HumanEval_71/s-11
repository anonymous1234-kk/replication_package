I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
```

    Otherwise return -1

    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
    if a + b <= c or b + c <= a or c + a <= b:
        return -1
    else:
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
        return round(area, 2)
```

You can test the function by calling it with different arguments, like this:

```python
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # should print 6.0
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # should print -1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(4,3,6) == 5.33
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
