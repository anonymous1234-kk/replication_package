I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''
```

```python

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''

    # Check if the given sides form a valid triangle
    if (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a):
        # Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        # Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula
        area = (s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c)) ** 0.5
        # Round off the area to 2 decimal points and return
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        # Return -1 if the given sides do not form a valid triangle
        return -1
```

You can now call the `triangle_area()` function with three sides of a triangle to get its area. For example:
```python
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.0
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Output: -1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert triangle_area(4,3,6) == 5.33
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
