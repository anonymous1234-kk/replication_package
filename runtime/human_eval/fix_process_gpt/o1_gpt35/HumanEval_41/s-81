You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert car_race_collision(9) == 81
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
