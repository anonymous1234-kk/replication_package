I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def count_nums(arr):
    """
    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
    >>> count_nums([]) == 0
    >>> count_nums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
    >>> count_nums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert count_nums([-10, -20, -30, -40, -50, -60, -70, -80, -90, -100]) == 0
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert count_nums([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]) == 10
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
