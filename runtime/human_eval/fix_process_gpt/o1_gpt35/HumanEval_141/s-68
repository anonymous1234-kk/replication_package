I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert file_name_check('example.txt22') == No
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
