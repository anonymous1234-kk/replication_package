You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
```

```python

def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """

    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    count = 0 # initialize the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1 to zero
    
    if n < 1: # if n is less than 1, return zero
        return 0
    
    # calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1
    count += 9 # for each position of the n-digit number except the first and last, there are 9 possible digits (0 to 9) that are not 1
    count += 1 # for the first digit, there is only 1 possible digit (1) that is allowed
    if n > 1: # if n is greater than 1, the last digit can also be 1, so add 1 to the count
        count += 1
    
    return count # return the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert starts_one_ends(9) == 180000000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
