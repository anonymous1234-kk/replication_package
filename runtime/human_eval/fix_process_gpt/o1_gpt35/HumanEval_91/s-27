I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
```

    """

    bored_count = 0
    
    # Split the string into individual sentences
    sentences = S.split('.')
    sentences = [s.strip() for s in sentences if s.strip()]
    
    sentences = [s.split('?') for s in sentences]
    sentences = [s for sublist in sentences for s in sublist]
    sentences = [s.strip() for s in sentences if s.strip()]
    
    sentences = [s.split('!') for s in sentences]
    sentences = [s for sublist in sentences for s in sublist]
    sentences = [s.strip() for s in sentences if s.strip()]
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence.startswith("I "):
            bored_count += 1
    
    return bored_count
```

You can call the function with a string as its argument to see if it works correctly. For example:

```python
print(is_bored("Hello world"))
# Output: 0

print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))
# Output: 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_bored('I am happy. I love my family. I love this weather') == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
