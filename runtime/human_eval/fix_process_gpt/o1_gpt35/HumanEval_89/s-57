I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """
```

    # Initialize the encrypted string
    encrypted_s = ''

    # Encrypt each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Get the index of the character in the original alphabet
        idx = alphabet.find(char)

        # If the character is not in the alphabet, append it to the encrypted string as is
        if idx == -1:
            encrypted_s += char
        else:
            # Get the corresponding character in the rotated alphabet and append it to the encrypted string

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert encrypt('LCW') == PGA
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert encrypt('hiiq') == lmmu
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
