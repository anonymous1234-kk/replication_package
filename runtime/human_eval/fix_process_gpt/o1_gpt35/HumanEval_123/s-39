I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_odd_collatz(6) == [1, 3, 5]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_odd_collatz(15) == [1, 5, 15, 23, 35, 53]
assert get_odd_collatz(9) == [1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
