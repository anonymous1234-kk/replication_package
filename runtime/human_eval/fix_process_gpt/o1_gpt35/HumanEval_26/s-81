You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python
from typing import List


def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
```

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:

    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])

    # Create an empty list to store unique elements
    unique_numbers = []

    for number in numbers:
        
        # If the current element is not in the unique_numbers list, append it
        if number not in unique_numbers:
            unique_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the unique_numbers list
    return unique_numbers

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert remove_duplicates([2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3, 4]) == [6, 9]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.

Here's the fixed code:

    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """

    # Create an empty list to store unique elements
    unique_numbers = []
    duplicates = set()

    # Traverse through the elements of the input list
    for number in numbers:
        
        # If the current element is not in the unique_numbers list and not in duplicates, append it
        if number not in unique_numbers and number not in duplicates:
            unique_numbers.append(number)
        else:
            duplicates.add(number)
