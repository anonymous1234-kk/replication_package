You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert find_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == -0.71
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
