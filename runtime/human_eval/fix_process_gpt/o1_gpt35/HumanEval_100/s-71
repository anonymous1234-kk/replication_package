I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert make_a_pile(30) == [30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
