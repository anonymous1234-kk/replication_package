I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
```

    1
    """

    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of boredoms
    num_boredoms = 0
    
    # Split the string into sentences
    sentences = S.split('.')
    sentences += S.split('?')
    sentences += S.split('!')
    
    # Loop through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if sentence.strip().startswith("I"):
            # If it does, increment the boredom count
            num_boredoms += 1
    
    # Return the number of boredoms
    return num_boredoms
```

You can test the implementation using the given test cases:

```python
# Test case 1
assert is_bored("Hello world") == 0

# Test case 2
assert is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather") == 1

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert is_bored('I am happy. I love my family. I love this weather') == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
