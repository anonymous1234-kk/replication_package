You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    """You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between 
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).
    
    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel met the above condition. 

    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.

    Example:
    get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
    get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
    get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
    get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert get_closest_vowel('xyzaei') == 
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert get_closest_vowel('myth') == 
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
