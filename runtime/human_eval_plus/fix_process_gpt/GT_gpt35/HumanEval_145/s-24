I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def order_by_points(nums):
    """
    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers
    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.
    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,
    order them based on their index in original list.

    For example:
    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
    >>> order_by_points([]) == []
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert order_by_points([-23, 1, 4, 2]) == [-23, 1, 2, 4]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
