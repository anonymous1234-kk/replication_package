You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
```

```python

def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """

    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    # Total count of numbers that start or end with 1
    count = 0
    
    # If n is 1, there is only one number that satisfies the condition
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Count of numbers that start with 1
    count_start = 9
    
    # Count of numbers that end with 1
    count_end = 10
    
    # Count of numbers that start and end with 1
    count_start_end = 1
    
    # Loop through the remaining n-2 digits
    for i in range(2, n):
        count_start = count_start * 10 + 9
        count_end = count_end * 10
        count_start_end = count_start_end * 10 + 1
        
    count = count_start + count_end - count_start_end
    
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert starts_one_ends(9) == 180000000
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
