You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def fibfib(n: int):
    """The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
    >>> fibfib(1)
    0
    >>> fibfib(5)
    4
    >>> fibfib(8)
    24
    """

----------------------User Message----------------------
The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert fibfib(12) == 274
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
