I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert solve(10000) == 1
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
