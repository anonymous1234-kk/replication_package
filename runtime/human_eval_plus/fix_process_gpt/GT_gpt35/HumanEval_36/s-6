I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
```

    # Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of 7s
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through all integers less than n
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            # Convert the integer to a string and check if it contains the digit 7
            if '7' in str(i):
                count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of 7s found
    return count

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert fizz_buzz(100) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert fizz_buzz(0) == 0
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
