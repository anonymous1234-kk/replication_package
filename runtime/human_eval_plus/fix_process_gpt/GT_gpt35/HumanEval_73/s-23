I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == 4
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]) == 2
assert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]) == 8
assert smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) == 4
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
