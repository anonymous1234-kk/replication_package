I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """
```

            # Calculate the factorial of i
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                fact *= j
            res.append(fact)
        else:

    return res

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert f(11) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15, 720, 28, 40320, 45, 3628800, 66]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
