You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

Here is the question.
```python

def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert tri(15) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0, 4.0, 24.0, 5.0, 35.0, 6.0, 48.0, 7.0, 63.0, 8.0, 80.0]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert tri(1) == [1, 3]
assert tri(1) == [1, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
