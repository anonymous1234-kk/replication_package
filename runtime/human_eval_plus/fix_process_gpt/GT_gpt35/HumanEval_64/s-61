You are a helpful AI assistant.
----------------------User Message----------------------
I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

FIX = """
Add more test cases.
"""

def vowels_count(s):
    """Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Example:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert vowels_count('BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVXZbcdfghjklmnpqrstvxzAEIOUYaeiouy') == 11
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert vowels_count('Thiea euei') == 7
assert vowels_count('Thieaa eiaae') == 9
assert vowels_count('aeioub') == 5
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
