You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python


def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
```

    divisible_by_3 = sorted([i for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0])
    divisible_by_3_values = [l[i] for i in divisible_by_3]
    l_copy = l.copy()
    for i, value in zip(divisible_by_3, divisible_by_3_values):
        l_copy[i] = value
    return l_copy

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9]) == [4, 6, 3, 5, 8, 9]
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert sort_third([5, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]) == [5, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
assert sort_third([5, None, 8, 7, 2, 3]) == [5, None, 8, 7, 2, 3]
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
