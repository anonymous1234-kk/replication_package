You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
    duplicate values.

    Examples:
    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1
    """
```

        else:
            index = i - 1
    return index

```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert can_arrange([1, 4, 3, 2, 5]) == 3
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
