You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert exchange([3, 5, 7, 10],[4, 8]) == NO
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python
assert exchange([],[]) == YES
assert exchange([2, 4],[1, 3]) == YES
assert exchange([2, 6, 8],[9, 11, 13]) == YES
```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
