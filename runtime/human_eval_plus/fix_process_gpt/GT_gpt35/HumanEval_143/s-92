You are a helpful AI assistant.

I want you to act like a Python programmer. I will give you the declaration of a function and comments about its property. You need to implement the body of the function in the code block. Do not modify any code I provide.

OK, I'm ready to help.

Here is the question.
```python

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """
```

The generated code is not correct on the following test case, please fix the code to pass it and return the complete fixed code.
```python
assert words_in_sentence('Consequetive numbers are here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9') == numbers are
```
 Besides the above test case, the code should also pass the following test cases, which are already passed previously:
```python

```
.
 You only need to generate the fixed code, do not provide any assert statements or explanations.
